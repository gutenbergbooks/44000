  VERTEBRATES</span></p>

  <p class="sp3 ac"><i>INTRODUCTION</i></p>

  <p>In former days it was possible for a man like Johannes M√ºller to be a leader both in physiology
  and in comparative anatomy. Nowadays all scientific knowledge has increased so largely that
  specialization is inevitable, and every investigator is confined more and more not only to one
  department of science, but as a rule to one small portion of that department. In the case of such
  cognate sciences as physiology and comparative anatomy this limiting of the scope of view is
  especially deleterious, for zoology without physiology is dead, and physiology in many of its
  departments without comparative anatomy can advance but little. Then, again, the too exclusive
  study of one subject always tends to force the mind into a special groove&mdash;into a line of
  thought so deeply tinged with the prevalent teaching of the subject, that any suggestions which
  arise contrary to such teaching are apt to be dismissed at once as heretical and not worthy of
  further thought; whereas the same suggestion arising in the mind of one outside this particular
  line of thought may give rise to new and valuable scientific discoveries.</p>

  <p>Nothing but good can, in my opinion, result from the incursion of the non-specialist into the
  realm of the specialist, provided that the former is in earnest. Over and over again the chemist
  has given valuable help to the physicist, and the physicist to the chemist, so closely allied are
  the two subjects; so also is it with physiology and anatomy, the two subjects are so
  interdependent that a worker in the one may give valuable aid towards the solution of some large
  problem which is the special territory of the other.</p>

  <p>It has been a matter of surprise to many how it came about that <span class="pagenum"
  id="page2">{2}</span>I, a worker in the physiological laboratory at Cambridge ever since Foster
  introduced experimental physiology into English-speaking nations, should have devoted so much time
  to the promulgation of a theory of the origin of vertebrates&mdash;a subject remote from
  physiology, and one of the larger questions appertaining to comparative anatomy. By what process
  of thought was I led to take up the consideration of a subject apparently so remote from all my
  previous work, and so foreign to the atmosphere of a physiological laboratory?</p>

  <p>It may perhaps be instructive to my readers to see how one investigation leads to another,
  until at last, <i>nolens volens</i>, the worker finds himself in front of a possible solution to a
  problem far removed from his original investigation, which by the very magnitude and importance of
  it forces him to devote his whole energy and time to seeing whether his theory is good.</p>

  <p>In the years 1880-1884 I was engaged in the investigation of the action of the heart, and the
  nature of the nerves which regulate that action. In the course of that investigation I was struck
  by the ease with which it was possible to distinguish between the fibres of the vagus and
  accelerator nerves on their way to the heart, owing to the medullation of the former and the
  non-medullation of the latter. This led me to an investigation of the accelerator fibres, to find
  out how far they are non-medullated, and so to the discovery that the <i>rami communicantes</i>
  connecting together the central nervous system and the sympathetic are in reality single, not
  double, as had hitherto been thought; for the grey <i>ramus communicans</i> is in reality a
  peripheral nerve which supplies the blood-vessels of the spinal cord and its membranes, and is of
  the same nature as the grey accelerators to the heart.</p>

  <p>This led to the conclusion that there is no give and take between two independent nervous
  systems, the cerebro-spinal and the sympathetic, as had been taught formerly, but only one nervous
  system, the cerebro-spinal, which sends special medullated nerve-fibres, characterized by their
  smallness, to the cells of the sympathetic system, from which fibres pass to the periphery,
  usually non-medullated. These fine medullated nerves form the system of white <i>rami
  communicantes</i>, and have since been called by Langley the preganglionic nerves. Further
  investigation showed that such white rami are not universally distributed, but are confined to the
  thoracico-lumbar region, where their distribution is easily seen in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page3">{3}</span>the ventral roots, for the cells of the sympathetic system are entirely
  efferent in nature, not afferent; therefore, the fibres entering into them from the central
  nervous system leave the spinal cord by ventral, not dorsal roots.</p>

  <p>Following out this clue, I then found that in addition to this thoracico-lumbar outflow of
  efferent ganglionated visceral nerves, there are similar outflows in the cranial and sacral
  regions, belonging in the former case especially to the vagus system of nerves, and in the latter
  to the system of nerves which pass from the sacral region of the cord to the ganglion-cells of the
  hypogastric plexus, and from them supply the bladder, rectum, etc. To this system of nerves,
  formerly called the <i>nervi erigentes</i>, I gave the name pelvic splanchnics, in order to show
  their uniformity with the abdominal splanchnics. These investigations led to the conclusion that
  the organic system of nerves, characterized by the possession of efferent nerve-cells situated
  peripherally, arises from the central nervous system by three distinct outflows&mdash;cranial,
  thoracico-lumbar, and sacral, respectively. To this system Langley has lately given the name
  'autonomic.' These three outflows are separated by two gaps just where the plexuses for the
  anterior and posterior extremities come in.</p>

  <p>This peculiar arrangement of the white <i>rami communicantes</i> set me thinking, for the gaps
  corresponded to an increase of somatic musculature to form the muscles of the fore and hind limbs,
  so that if, as seemed probable, the white <i>rami communicantes</i> arise segmentally from the
  spinal cord, then a marked distinction must exist in structure between the spinal cord in the
  thoracic region, where the visceral efferent nerves are large in amount and the body musculature
  scanty, and in the cervical or lumbar swellings, where the somatic musculature abounds, and the
  white <i>rami communicantes</i> scarcely exist.</p>

  <p>I therefore directed my attention in the next place to the structure of the central nervous
  system in the endeavour to associate the topographical arrangement of cell-groups in this system
  with the outflow of the different kinds of nerve-fibres to the peripheral organs.</p>

  <p>This investigation forcibly impressed upon my mind the uniformity in the arrangement of the
  central nervous system as far as the centres of origin of all the segmental nerves are concerned,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page4">{4}</span>both cranial and spinal, and also the original
  segmental character of this part of the nervous system.</p>

  <p>I could not, therefore, help being struck by the force of the comparison between the central
  nervous systems of Vertebrata and Appendiculata as put forward again and again by the past
  generation of comparative anatomists, and wondered why it had been discredited. There in the
  infundibulum was the old &#x0153;sophagus, there in the cranial segmental nerves the
  infra&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, there in the cerebral hemispheres and optic and olfactory nerves
  the supra&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, there in the spinal cord the ventral chain of ganglia. But if
  the infundibulum was the old &#x0153;sophagus, what then? The old &#x0153;sophagus was continuous
  with and led into the cephalic stomach. What about the infundibulum? It was continuous with and
  led into the ventricles of the brain, and the whole thing became clear. The ventricles of the
  brain were the old cephalic stomach, and the canal of the spinal cord the long straight intestine
  which led originally to the anus, and still in the vertebrate embryo opens out into the anus. Not
  having been educated in a morphological laboratory and taught that the one organ which is
  homologous throughout the animal kingdom is the gut, and that therefore the gut of the
  invertebrate ancestor must continue on as the gut of the vertebrate, the conception that the
  central nervous system has grown round and enclosed the original ancestral gut, and that the
  vertebrate has formed a new gut did not seem to me so impossible as to prevent my taking it as a
  working hypothesis, and seeing to what it would lead.</p>

  <p>This theory that the so-called central nervous system of the vertebrate is in reality composed
  of two separate parts, of which the one, the segmented part, corresponds to the central nervous
  system of the highest invertebrates, while the other, the unsegmented tube, was originally the
  alimentary canal of that same invertebrate, came into my mind in the year 1887. The following
  year, on June 23, 1888, I read a paper on the subject before the Anatomical Society at Cambridge,
  which was published in the <i>Journal of Anatomy and Physiology</i>, vol. 23, and more fully in
  the <i>Journal of Physiology</i>, vol. 10. Since that time I have been engaged in testing the
  theory in every possible way, and have published the results of my investigations in a series of
  papers in different journals, a list of which I append at the end of this introductory
  chapter.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page5">{5}</span></div>

  <p>It is now twenty years since the theory first came into my mind, and the work of those twenty
  years has convinced me more and more of its truth, and yet during the whole time it has been
  ignored by the morphological world as a whole rather than criticized. Whatever may have been the
  causes for such absence of criticism, it is clear that the serial character of its publication is
  a hindrance to criticism of the theory as a whole, and I hope, therefore, that the publication of
  the whole of the twenty years' work in book-form will induce those who differ from my conclusions
  to come forward and show me where I am wrong, and why my theory is untenable. Any one who has been
  thinking over any one problem for so long a time becomes obsessed with the infallibility of his
  own views, and is not capable of criticizing his own work as thoroughly as others would do. I have
  been told that it is impossible for one man to consider so vast a subject with that thoroughness
  which is necessary, before any theory can be accepted as the true solution of the problem. I
  acknowledge the vastness of the task, and feel keenly enough my own shortcomings. For all that, I
  do feel that it can only be of advantage to scientific progress and a help to the solution of this
  great problem, to bring together in one book all the facts which I have been able to collect,
  which appeal to me as having an important bearing on this solution.</p>

  <p>In this work I have been helped throughout by Miss R. Alcock. It is not too much to say that
  without the assistance she has given me, many an important link in the chain of evidence would
  have been missing. With extraordinary patience she has followed, section by section, the smallest
  nerves to their destination, and has largely helped to free the transformation process in the
  lamprey from the mystery which has hitherto enveloped it. She has drawn for me very many of the
  illustrations scattered through the pages in this book, and I feel that her aid has been so
  valuable and so continuous, lasting as it does over the whole period of the work, that her name
  ought fittingly to be associated with mine, if perchance the theory of the Origin of Vertebrates,
  advocated in the pages of this book, gains acceptance.</p>

  <p class="sp5">I am also indebted to Mr. J. Stanley Gardiner and to Dr. A. Sheridan Lea for
  valuable assistance in preparing this book for the press. I desire to express my grateful thanks
  to the former for valuable criticism of the scientific evidence which I have brought <span
  class="pagenum" id="page6">{6}</span>forward in this book, and to the latter for his great
  kindness in undertaking the laborious task of collecting the proofs.</p>

  </div>

  <p>At the present time it is no longer a debatable question whether or no Evolution has taken
  place. Since the time of Darwin the accumulation of facts in its support has been so overwhelming
  that all zoologists look upon this question as settled, and desire now to find out the manner in
  which such evolution has taken place. Here two problems offer themselves for investigation, which
  can be and are treated separately&mdash;the one dealing with the question of those laws of
  heredity and variation which have brought about in the past and are still causing in the present
  the evolution of living beings, <i>i.e.</i> the causes of evolution; the other concerned with the
  relationship of animals, or groups of animals, rather than with the causes which have brought
  about such relationship, <i>i.e.</i> the sequence of evolution.</p>

  <p>It is the latter problem with which this book deals, and, indeed, not with the whole question
  at all, but only with that part of it which concerns the origin of vertebrates.</p>

  <p>This problem of the sequence of evolution is of a twofold character: first, the finding out of
  the steps by which the higher forms in any one group of animals have been evolved from the lower;
  and secondly, the evolution of the group itself from a lower group.</p>

  <p>In any classification of the animal kingdom, it is clear that large groups of animals exist
  which have so many common characteristics as to necessitate their being placed in one larger group
  or kingdom; <span class="pagenum" id="page9">{9}</span>thus zoologists are able to speak
  definitely of the Vertebrata, Arthropoda, Annelida, Echinodermata, Porifera, C&#x0153;lenterata,
  Mollusca, etc. In each of these groups affinities can be traced between the members, so that it is
  possible to speak of the progress from lower to higher members of the group, and it is
  conceivable, given time to work out the details, that the natural relationships between the
  members of the whole group will ultimately be discovered.</p>

  <p>Thus no one can doubt that a sequence of the kind has taken place in the Vertebrata as we trace
  the progress from the lowest fishes to man, and already the discoveries of pal√¶ontology and
  anatomy give us a distinct clue to the sequence from fish to amphibian, from amphibian to reptile,
  from reptile to mammal on the one hand, and to bird on the other. That the different members of
  the vertebrate group are related to each other in orderly sequence is no longer a matter of doubt;
  the connected problems are matters of detail, the solution of which is certain sooner or later.
  The same may be said of the members of any of the other great natural groups, such as the
  Arthropoda, the Annelida, the Echinodermata, etc.</p>

  <p>It is different, however, when an attempt is made to connect two of the main divisions
  themselves. It is true enough that there is every reason to believe that the arthropod group has
  been evolved from the segmented annelid, and so the whole of the segmented invertebrates may be
  looked on as forming one big division, the Appendiculata, all the members of which will some day
  be arranged in orderly sequence, but the same feeling of certainty does not exist in other
  cases.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the very case of the origin of the Appendiculata we are confronted with one of
  the large problems of evolution&mdash;the origin of segmented from non-segmented animals&mdash;the
  solution of which is not yet known.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Theories of the Origin of Vertebrates.</span></p>

  <p>The other large problem, perhaps the most important of all, is the question of the relationship
  of the great kingdom of the Vertebrata: from what invertebrate group did the vertebrate arise?</p>

  <p>The great difficulty which presents itself in attempting a solution of this question is not so
  much, as used to be thought, the difficulty of deriving a group of animals possessing an internal
  bony and <span class="pagenum" id="page10">{10}</span>cartilaginous skeleton from a group
  possessing an external skeleton of a calcareous or chitinous nature, but rather the difficulty
  caused by the fundamental difference of arrangement of the important internal organs, especially
  the relative positions of the central nervous system and the digestive tube.</p>

  <div class="ac w50 fcenter sp2">

      ventral side; D, dorsal side.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now, if we take a broad and comprehensive view of the invertebrate kingdom, without arguing out
  each separate case, we find that it bears strongly the stamp of a general plan of evolution
  derived from a c&#x0153;lenterate animal, whose central nervous system formed a ring surrounding
  the mouth. Then when the radial symmetry was given up, and an elongated, bilateral, segmented form
  evolved, the central nervous system also became elongated and segmented, but, owing to its
  derivation from an oral ring, it still surrounded the mouth-tube, or &#x0153;sophagus, and thus in
  its highest forms is divided into supra-&#x0153;sophageal and infra-&#x0153;sophageal nervous
  masses. These latter <span class="pagenum" id="page11">{11}</span>nervous masses are of necessity
  ventral to the digestive tube, because the mouth of the c&#x0153;lenterate is on the ventral side.
  The striking characteristic, then, of the invertebrate kingdom is the situation of a large portion
  of the central nervous system ventrally to the alimentary canal and the piercing of the nervous
  system by a tube&mdash;the &#x0153;sophagus&mdash;leading from the mouth to the alimentary canal.
  The equally striking characteristic of the vertebrate is the dorsal position of the central
  nervous system and the ventral position of the alimentary canal combined with the absence of any
  piercing of the central nervous system by the &#x0153;sophagus.</p>

  <p>So fundamentally different is the arrangement of the important organs in the two groups that it
  might well give rise to a feeling of despair of ever hoping to solve the problem of the Origin of
  Vertebrates; and, to my mind, this is the prevalent feeling among morphologists at the present
  time. Two attempts at solution have been made. The one is associated with the name of Geoffrey St.
  Hilaire, and is based on the supposition that the vertebrate has arisen from the invertebrate by
  turning over on its back, swimming in this position, and so gradually converting an originally
  dorsal surface into a ventral one, and <i>vice vers√¢</i>; at the same time, a new mouth is
  supposed to have been formed on the new ventral side, which opened directly into the alimentary
  canal, while the old mouth, which had now become dorsal, was obliterated.</p>

  <p>The other attempt at solution is of much more recent date, and is especially associated with
  the name of Bateson. It supposes that bilaterally symmetrical, elongated, segmented animals were
  formed from the very first in two distinct ways. In the one case the digestive tube pierced the
  central nervous system, and was situated dorsally to its main mass. In the other case the
  segmented central nervous system was situated from the first dorsally to the alimentary canal, and
  was not pierced by it. In the first case the highest result of evolution led to the Arthropoda; in
  the second case to the Vertebrata.</p>

  <p>Neither of these views is based on evidence so strong as to cause universal acceptance. The
  great difficulty in the way of accepting the second alternative is the complete absence of any
  evidence, either among animals living on the earth at the present day or among those known to have
  existed in the past, of any such chain of intermediate animal forms as must, on this hypothesis,
  have existed in order to link together the lower forms of life with the vertebrates.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;<span class="sc">Larval
      Balanoglossus</span> (from the Royal Natural History).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It has been supposed that the Tunicata and the Enteropneusta (<i>Balanoglossus</i>) (Fig. <a
  href="#fig2">2</a>) are members of this missing chain, and that in Amphioxus the vertebrate
  approaches in organization to these low invertebrate forms. The tunicates, indeed, are looked upon
  as degenerate members of an early vertebrate stock, which may give help in picturing the nature of
  the vertebrate ancestor but are not themselves in the direct line of descent. Balanoglossus is
  supposed to have arisen from the Echinodermata, or at all events to have affinities with them, so
  that to fill up the enormous gap between the Echinodermata and the Vertebrata on this theory there
  is absolutely nothing living on the earth except Balanoglossus, Rhabdopleura, and Cephalodiscus.
  The characteristics of the vertebrate upon which this second theory is based are the notochord,
  the respiratory character of the anterior part of the alimentary canal, and the tubular nature of
  the central nervous system; it is claimed that in Balanoglossus the beginnings of a notochord and
  a tubular central nervous system are to be found, while the respiratory portion of the gut is
  closely comparable to that of Amphioxus.</p>

  <p>The strength of the first theory is essentially based on the comparison of the vertebrate
  central nervous system with that of the segmented invertebrate, annelid or arthropod. In the
  latter the central nervous system is composed of&mdash;</p>

  <p>1.  The supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, which give origin to the nerves of the eyes and
  antennules, <i>i.e.</i> to the optic and olfactory nerves, for the first pair of antenn√¶ are
  olfactory in function. These are connected with the infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia by the
  &#x0153;sophageal commissures which encircle the &#x0153;sophagus.</p>

  <p>2.  The infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia and the two chains of ventral ganglia, which are
  segmentally-arranged sets of ganglia. Of these, <span class="pagenum" id="page13">{13}</span>each
  pair gives rise to the nerves of its own segment, and these nerves are not nerves of special sense
  as are the supra-&#x0153;sophageal nerves, but motor and sensory to the segment; nerves by the
  agency of which food is taken in and masticated, respiration is effected, and the animal moves
  from place to place.</p>

  <p>In the vertebrate the central nervous system consists of&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The brain proper, from which arise only the olfactory and optic nerves.</p>

      <i>&#x0152;s. Com.</i>, &#x0153;sophageal commissures.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>2. The region of the mid-brain, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord; from these arises a series
  of nerves segmentally arranged, which, as in the invertebrate, gives origin to the nerves
  governing mastication, respiration, and locomotion.</p>

  <p>Further, the vertebrate central nervous system possesses the peculiarity, found nowhere else,
  of being tubular, and the tube is of a striking character. In the spinal region it is a small,
  simple canal of uniform calibre, which at the front end dilates to form the ventricles of the
  region of the brain. From that part of this dilated <span class="pagenum"
  id="page14">{14}</span>portion, known as the third ventricle, a narrow tube passes to the ventral
  surface of the brain. This tube is called the <i>infundibulum</i>, and, extraordinary to relate,
  lies just anteriorly to the exits of the third cranial or oculomotor nerves; in other words, it
  marks the termination of the series of spinal and cranial segmental nerves. Further, on each side
  of this infundibular tube are lying the two thick masses of the <i>crura cerebri</i>, the strands
  of fibres which connect the higher brain-region proper with the lower region of the medulla
  oblongata and spinal cord. Not only, then, are the nerve-masses in the two systems exactly
  comparable, but in the very place where the &#x0153;sophageal tube is found in the invertebrate,
  the infundibular tube exists in the vertebrate, so that if the words infundibular and
  &#x0153;sophageal are taken to be interchangable, then in every respect the two central nervous
  systems are comparable. The brain proper of the vertebrate, with its olfactory and optic nerves,
  becomes the direct descendant of the supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia; the crura cerebri become the
  &#x0153;sophageal commissures, and the cranial and spinal segmental nerves are respectively the
  nerves belonging to the infra-&#x0153;sophageal and ventral chain of ganglia.</p>

  <p>This overwhelmingly strong evidence has always pointed directly to the origin of the vertebrate
  from some form among the segmented group of invertebrates, annelid or arthropod, in which the
  original &#x0153;sophagus had become converted into the infundibulum, and a new mouth formed. So
  far, the position of this school of anatomists was extremely sound, for it is impossible to
  dispute the facts on which it is based. Still, however, the fact remained that the gut of the
  vertebrate lies ventrally to the nervous system, while that of the invertebrate lies dorsally;
  consequently, since the infundibulum was in the position of the invertebrate &#x0153;sophagus, it
  must originally have entered into the gut, and since the vertebrate gut was lying ventrally to it,
  it could only have opened into that gut in the invertebrate stage by the shifting of dorsal and
  ventral surfaces. From this argument it followed that the remains of the original mouth into which
  the infundibulum, <i>i.e.</i> &#x0153;sophagus, opened were to be sought for on the dorsal side of
  the vertebrate brain. Here in all vertebrates there are two spots where the roof of the brain is
  very thin, the one in the region of the pineal body, and the other constituting the roof of the
  fourth ventricle. Both of these places have had their advocates as the position of the old mouth,
  the former being upheld by Owen, the latter by Dohrn.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page15">{15}</span></div>

  <p>The discovery that the pineal body was originally an eye, or, rather, a pair of eyes, has
  perhaps more than anything else proved the impossibility of accepting this reversal of surfaces as
  an explanation of the genesis of the vertebrate from the annelid group. For whereas a pair of eyes
  close to the mid-dorsal line is not only likely enough, but is actually found to exist among large
  numbers of arthropods, both living and extinct, a pair of eyes situated close to the mid-ventral
  line near the mouth is not only unheard of in nature, but so improbable as to render impossible
  the theory which necessitates such a position.</p>

  <p>Yet this very discovery gives the strongest possible additional support to the close identity
  in the plan of the central nervous system of vertebrate and appendiculate.</p>

  <p>A truly paradoxical situation! The very discovery which may almost be said to prove the truth
  of the hypothesis, is the very one which has done most to discredit it, because in the minds of
  its authors the only possible solution of the transition from the one group to the other was by
  means of the reversal of surfaces.</p>

  <p>Still, as already said, even if the theory advanced to explain the facts be discredited, the
  facts remain the same; and still to this day an explanation is required as to why such
  extraordinary resemblances should exist between the two nervous systems, unless there is a genetic
  connection between the two groups of animals. An explanation may still be found, and must be
  diligently sought for, which shall take into account the strong evidence of this relationship
  between the two groups, and yet not necessitate any reversal of surfaces. It is the object of this
  book to consider the possibility of such an explanation.</p>

  <p>What are the lines of investigation most likely to meet with success? Is it possible to lay
  down any laws of evolution? It is instructive to consider the nature of the investigations which
  have led to the two theories just mentioned, for the fundamental starting-point is remarkably
  different in the two cases. The one theory is based upon the study of the vertebrate itself, and
  especially of its central nervous system, and its supporters and upholders have been and are
  essentially anatomists, whose chief study is that of vertebrate and human anatomy. The other
  theory is based upon the study of the invertebrate, and consists especially of an attempt to find
  in the invertebrate some structure resembling a notochord, such <span class="pagenum"
  id="page16">{16}</span>organ being considered by them as the great characteristic of the
  vertebrate; indeed, so much is this the case, that a large number of zoologists speak now of
  Chordata rather than of Vertebrata, and in order to emphasize their position follow Bateson, and
  speak of the Tunicata as Uro-chordata, of Amphioxus as Cephalo-chordata, of the Enteropneusta as
  Hemi-chordata, and even of Actinotrocha (to use Masterman's term), as Diplo-chordata.</p>

  <p>The upholders of this theory lay no stress on the nature of the central nervous system in
  vertebrates, they are essentially zoologists who have made a special study of the invertebrate
  rather than of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>Of these two methods of investigating the problem, it must be conceded that the former is more
  likely to give reliable results. By putting the vertebrate to the question in every possible way,
  by studying its anatomy and physiology, both gross and minute, by inquiring into its past history,
  we can reasonably hope to get a clue to its origin, but by no amount of investigation can we tell
  with any certainty what will be its future fate; we can only guess and prophesy in an uncertain
  and hesitating manner. So it must be with any theory of the origin of vertebrates, based on the
  study of one or other invertebrate group. Such theory must partake rather of the nature of
  prophecy than of deduction, and can only be placed on a firm basis when it so happens that the
  investigation of the vertebrate points irresistibly to its origin from the same group; in fact,
  "never prophesy unless you know."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The first principle, then, I would lay down is this: In order to find out the
  origin of vertebrates, inquire, in the first place, of the vertebrate itself.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Importance of the Central Nervous System.</span></p>

  <p>Does the history of evolution pick out any particular organ or group of organs as more
  necessary than another for upward progress? If so, it is upon that organ or group of organs that
  special stress must be laid.</p>

  <p>Since Darwin wrote the "Origin of Species," and laid down that the law of the 'survival of the
  fittest' is the factor upon which evolution depends, it has gradually dawned upon the scientific
  mind that 'the fittest' may be produced in two diametrically opposite ways: <span class="pagenum"
  id="page17">{17}</span>either by progress upwards to a superior form, or by degeneration to a
  lower type of animal. The principle of degeneration as a factor in the formation of groups of
  animals, which are thereby enabled to survive, is nowadays universally admitted. The most striking
  example is to be found in the widely distributed group of Tunicata, which live, in numbers of
  instances, a sedentary life upon the rocks, have the appearance of very low forms of animal life,
  propagate by budding, have lost all the characteristics of higher forms, and yet are considered to
  be derived from an original vertebrate stock. Such degenerate forms remain degenerate, and are
  never known to regenerate and again to reach the higher stage of evolution from which they arose.
  Such forms are of considerable interest, but cannot help, except negatively, to decide what factor
  is especially important for upward progress.</p>

  <p>At the head of the animal race at the present day stands man, and in mankind itself some races
  are recognized as higher than others. Such recognition is given essentially on account of their
  greater brain-power, and without doubt the great characteristic which puts man at the head is the
  development of his central nervous system, especially of the region of the brain. Not only is this
  point most manifest in distinguishing man from the lower animals, but it applies to the latter as
  well. By the amount of convolution of the brain, the amount of grey matter in the cerebral
  hemispheres, the enlargement and increasing complexity of the higher parts of the central nervous
  system, the anthropoid apes are differentiated from the lower forms, and the higher mammals from
  the lower. In the recent work of Elliot Smith, and of Edinger, most conclusive proof is given that
  the upward progress in the vertebrate phylum is correlated with the increase of brain-power, and
  the latter writer shows how steady and remarkable is the increase in substance and in complexity
  of the brain-region as we pass from the fishes, through the amphibians and reptiles, to the birds
  and mammals.</p>

  <p>The study of the forms which lived on the earth in past ages confirms and emphasizes this
  conclusion, for it is most striking to see how small is the cranium among the gigantic Dinosaurs;
  how in the great reptilian age the denizens of the earth were far inferior in brain-power to the
  lords of creation in after-times.</p>

  <p>What applies to the vertebrate phylum applies also to the invertebrate groups. Here also an
  upward progress is recognized as we <span class="pagenum" id="page18">{18}</span>pass from the
  sponges to the arthropods&mdash;a progress which is manifested, first by the concentration of
  nervous material to form a central nervous system, and then by the increase in substance and
  complexity of that nervous system to form a higher and a higher type, until the culmination is
  reached in the nervous system of the scorpions and spiders. No upward progress is possible with
  degeneration of the central nervous system, and in all those cases where a group owes its
  existence to degeneration, the central nervous system takes part in the degeneration.</p>

  <p>This law of the paramount importance of the growth of the central nervous system for all upward
  progress in the evolution of animals receives confirmation from the study of the development of
  individuals, especially in those cases where a large portion of the life of the animal is spent in
  a larval condition, and then, by a process of transformation, the larva changes into the adult
  form. Such cases are well known among Arthropoda, the familiar instance being the change from the
  larval caterpillar to the adult imago. Among Vertebrata, the change from the tadpole to the frog,
  from the larval form of the lamprey (<i>Ammoc&#x0153;tes</i>) to the adult form
  (<i>Petromyzon</i>), are well-known instances. In all such cases the larva shows signs of having
  attained a certain stage in evolution, and then a remarkable transformation takes place, with the
  result that an adult animal emerges, whose organization reaches a higher stage of evolution than
  that of the larva.</p>

  <p>This transformation process is characterized by a very great destruction of the larval tissues
  and a subsequent formation of new adult tissues. Most extensive is the destruction in the
  caterpillar and in the larval lamprey. But one organ never shares in this process of histolysis,
  and that is the central nervous system; amidst the ruins of the larva it remains, leading and
  directing the process of re-formation. In the Arthropoda, the larval alimentary canal may be
  entirely destroyed and eaten up by phagocytes, but the central nervous system not only remains
  intact but increases in size, and by the concentration and cephalization of its
  infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia forms in the adult a central nervous system of a higher type than
  that of the larva.</p>

  <p>So, too, in the transformation of the lamprey, there is not the slightest trace of any
  destruction in the central nervous system, but simply a development and increase in nervous
  material, which <span class="pagenum" id="page19">{19}</span>results in the formation of a brain
  region more like that of the higher vertebrates than exists in Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>In these cases the development is upward&mdash;the adult form is of a higher type than that of
  the larva. It is, however, possible for the reverse to occur, so that the individual development
  leads to degeneration, not to a higher type. Instances are seen in the Tunicata, and in various
  parasitic arthropod forms, such as Lern√¶a, etc. In these cases, the transformation from the larval
  to the adult form leads to degradation, and in this degradation the central nervous system is
  always involved.</p>

  <p>It is perhaps a truism to state that upward progress is necessarily accompanied by increased
  development of the central nervous system; but it is necessary to lay special stress upon the
  importance of the central nervous system in all problems of evolution, because there is, in my
  opinion, a tendency at the present time to ignore this factor to too great an extent.</p>

  <p>The law of progress is this&mdash;The race is not to the swift, nor to the strong, but to the
  wise.</p>

  <p>This law carries with it the necessary corollary that the immediate ancestor of the vertebrate
  must have had a central nervous system nearly approaching that of the lowest undegenerated
  vertebrate. Among all the animals living on the earth at the present time, the highest
  invertebrate group, the Arthropoda, possesses a central nervous system most closely resembling
  that of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The law, then, of the paramount importance of a steady development of the central
  nervous system for the upward progress of the animal kingdom, points directly to the arthropod as
  the most probable ancestor of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Evolution of Tissues.</span></p>

  <p>In the whole scheme of evolution we can recognize, not only an upward progress in the
  organization of the animal as a whole, but also a distinct advance in the structure of the tissues
  composing an individual, which accompanies that upward progress. Thus it is possible to speak of
  an evolution of the supporting tissues from the simplest form of connective tissue up to cartilage
  and thence to bone; of the contractile tissues, from the simplest contractile protoplasm <span
  class="pagenum" id="page20">{20}</span>to unstriped muscle, and thence to the highest forms of
  striated muscle; of the nervous connecting strands, from undifferentiated to fine strands, then to
  thicker, more separated ones, resembling non-medullated fibres, and finally to well-differentiated
  separate fibres, each enclosed in a medullated sheath.</p>

  <p>In the connective tissue group, bone is confined to the vertebrates, cartilage is found among
  invertebrates, and the closest resemblance to vertebrate embryonic or parenchymatous cartilage is
  found in the cartilage of Limulus. Also, as Gegenbaur has pointed out, Limulus, more than any
  other invertebrate, possesses a fibrous connective tissue resembling that of vertebrates.</p>

  <p>In the muscular group, Biedermann, who has made a special study of the physiology of striated
  muscle, says that among invertebrates the striated muscle of the arthropod group resembles most
  closely that of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the nervous group the resemblance between the nerve-fibres of Limulus and
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, both of which are devoid of any marked medullary sheath, is very apparent, and
  Retzius points out that the only evidence of medullation, so characteristic of the vertebrates, is
  found in a species of prawn (<i>Pal√¶mon</i>). In all these cases the nearest resemblance to the
  vertebrate tissues is to be found in the arthropod.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Evidence of Pal√¶ontology.</span></p>

  <p>Perhaps the most important of all the clues likely to help in the solution of the origin of
  vertebrates is that afforded by Geology, for although the geological record is admittedly so
  imperfect that we can never hope by its means alone to link together the animals at present in
  existence, yet it does undoubtedly point to a sequence in the evolution of animal forms, and gives
  valuable information as to the nature of such sequence. In different groups of animals there are
  times when the group can be spoken of as having attained its most flourishing period. During these
  geological epochs the distribution of the group was universal, the numbers were very great, the
  number of species was at the maximum, and some of them had attained a maximal size. Such races
  were at that time dominant, and the struggle for existence was essentially among members of the
  same group. At the present time the dominant race is man, and the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page21">{21}</span>struggle for existence is essentially between the members of that race, and
  not between them and any inferior race.</p>

  <p>The effect of such conditions is, as Darwin has pointed out, to cause great variation in that
  group; in consequence of that variation and that dominance the evolution of the next higher group
  is brought about from some member of the dominant group. Thus the present age is the outcome of
  the Tertiary period, a time when giant mammals roamed the earth and left as their successors the
  mammals of the present day; a time of dominance of quadruped mammals; a time of which the period
  of maximum development is long past, and we now see how the dominance of the biped mammal, man, is
  accompanied by the rapid diminution and approaching extermination of the larger mammals. No
  question can possibly arise as to the immediate ancestor of the biped mammal; he undoubtedly arose
  from one of the dominant quadrupedal mammals.</p>

  <p>Passing along to the next evidence of the rocks, we find an age of reptiles in the Mesozoic
  period. Here, again, the number and variety is most striking; here, again, the size is enormous in
  comparison with that of the present-day members of the group. This was the dominant race at the
  time when the birds and mammals first appeared on the earth, and anatomists recognize in these
  extinct reptilian forms two types; the one bird-like, the other more mammalian in character. From
  some members of the former group birds are supposed to have been evolved, and mammals from members
  of the other group. There is no question of their origin directly from lower fish-like forms; the
  time of their appearance on the earth, their structure, all point irresistibly to the same
  conclusion as we have arrived at from the consideration of the origin of the biped from the
  quadruped mammal, viz. that birds and mammals arose, in consequence of the struggle for existence,
  from some members of the reptilian race which at that time was the dominant one on earth.</p>

  <p>Passing down the geological record, we find that when the reptiles first appear in the
  Carboniferous age there is abundant evidence of the existence of numbers of amphibian forms. At
  this time the giant Labyrinthodonts flourished. Here among the swamps and marshes of the
  coal-period the prevalent vertebrate was amphibian in structure. Their variety and number were
  very great, and at that period they attained their greatest size. Here, again, from the geological
  record we draw the same conclusion as before, that the reptiles arose from the race which was then
  predominant on the earth&mdash;the Amphibia.</p>

  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page23">{23}</span></div>

  <p>Again, another point of great interest is seen here, and that is that these Labyrinthodonts, as
  Huxley has pointed out, possess characters which bring them more closely than the amphibians of
  the present day into connection with the fishes; and further, the fish-like characters they
  possessed are those of the Ganoids, the Marsipobranchs, the Dipnoans, and the Elasmobranchs,
  rather than of the Teleosteans.</p>

  <p>Now, it is a striking fact that the ancient fishes at the time when the amphibians appeared had
  not reached the teleostean stage. The ganoids and elasmobranchs swarmed in the waters of the
  Devonian and Carboniferous times. Dipnoans and marsipobranchs were there, too, in all probability,
  but teleosteans do not appear until the Mesozoic period. The very kinds of fish, then, which
  swarmed in the seas at that time, and were the predominant race before the Carboniferous epoch,
  are those to which the amphibians at their first appearance show the closest affinity. Here,
  again, the same law appears; from the predominant race at the time, the next higher race arose,
  and arose by a most striking modification, which was the consequence of altering the medium in
  which it lived. By coming out of the water and living on the land, or, rather, being able to live
  partly on land and partly in the water, by the acquisition of air-breathing respiratory organs or
  lungs in addition to, and instead of, water-breathing organs or gills, the amphibian not only
  arose from the fish, but made an entirely new departure in the sequence of progressive forms.</p>

  <p>This was a most momentous step in the history of evolution&mdash;one fraught with mighty
  consequences and full of most important suggestions.</p>

  <p>From this time onwards the struggle for existence by which upward progress ensued took place on
  the land, not in the sea, and, as has been pointed out, led to the evolution of reptiles from
  amphibians, birds and quadrupedal mammals from reptiles, and man from quadrupeds. In the sea the
  fishes were left to multiply and struggle among themselves, their only opponents being the giant
  cephalopods, which themselves had been evolved from a continual succession of the Mollusca. For
  this reason the struggle for existence between the fishes and the higher race evolved from them
  did not <span class="pagenum" id="page24">{24}</span>take place until some members of that higher
  race took again to the water, and so competed with the fish-tribe in their own element.</p>

  <p>Another most important conclusion to be derived from the uprising of the Amphibia is that at
  that time there was no race of animals living on the land which had a chance against them. No race
  of land-living animals had been evolved whose organization enabled them to compete with and
  overcome these intruders from the sea in the struggle for existence. For this reason that the
  whole land was their own, and no serious competition could arise from their congeners, the fish,
  they took possession of it, and increased mightily in size; losing more and more the habit of
  going into the water, becoming more and more truly terrestrial animals. Henceforth, then, in
  trying to find out the sequence of evolution, we must leave the land and examine the nature of the
  animals living in the sea; the air-breathing animals which lived on the land in the Upper Silurian
  and Devonian times cannot have reached a stage of organization comparable with that of the fishes,
  seeing how easily the amphibians became dominant.</p>

  <p>We arrive, then, at the conclusion that the ancestors of the fishes must have lived in the sea,
  and applying still the same principles that have held good up to this time, the ancestors of the
  fishes must have arisen from some member of the race predominant at the time when they first
  appeared, and also the earliest fishes must have much more closely resembled the ancestral form
  than those found in later times or at the present day.</p>

  <p>What, then, is the record of the rocks at the time of the first appearance of fish-like forms?
  What kind of fishes were they, and what was the predominant race at the time?</p>

  <p>We have now reached the Upper Silurian and Lower Devonian times, and most instructive and
  suggestive is the revelation of the rocks. Here, when the first vertebrates appeared, the sea was
  peopled with corals, brachiopods, early forms of cephalopods, and other invertebrates; but, above
  all, with the great tribe of trilobites (Fig. <a href="#fig6">6</a>) and their successors. From
  the trilobites arose, as evidenced by their larval form, the king-crab group, called the Xiphosura
  (Fig. <a href="#fig5">5</a>). Closely connected with them, and forming intermediate stages between
  trilobites and king-crabs, numerous forms have been discovered, known as Belinurus, Prestwichia,
  Hemiaspis, Bunodes, etc. (Fig. <a href="#fig5">5</a> and Fig. <a href="#fig12">12</a>). From them
  also arose the most striking group <span class="pagenum" id="page25">{25}</span>of animals which
  existed at this period&mdash;the giant sea-scorpions, or Gigantostraca. This group was closely
  associated with the king-crabs, and the two groups together are classified under the title
  Merostomata.</p>

  <div class="ac w45 fcenter sp3">

  <p>The appearance of these sea-scorpions is given in Figs. 7 and 8, representing Stylonurus,
  Slimonia, Pterygotus, Eurypterus. They must have been in those days the tyrants of the deep, for
  specimens of Pterygotus have been found over six feet in length.</p>

  <p>At this time, then, by every criterion hitherto used, by the multitude of species, by the size
  of individual species, which at this period reached the maximum, by their subsequent decay and
  final extinction, we must conclude that these forms were in their zenith, that the predominant
  race at this time was to be found in this group of arthropods. Just previously, the sea swarmed
  with trilobites, and right into the period when the Gigantostraca flourished, the trilobites <span
  class="pagenum" id="page26">{26}</span>are still found of countless forms, of great difference in
  size. The whole period may be spoken of as the great trilobite age, just as the Tertiary times
  form the mammalian age, the Mesozoic times the reptilian age, etc. From the trilobites the
  Gigantostraca and Xiphosura arose, as evidenced by the embryology of Limulus, and, therefore, in
  the term trilobite age would be included the whole of those peculiar forms which are classified by
  the names Trilobita, Gigantostraca, Xiphosura, etc. Of all these the only member alive at the
  present time is Limulus, or the King-Crab.</p>

  <p>As, however, the term 'trilobite' does not include the members of the king-crab or sea-scorpion
  groups, it is advisable to use some other term to represent the whole group. They cannot be called
  crustaceans or arachnids, for in all probability they gave origin to both; the nearest approach to
  the Trilobite stage of development at the present time is to be found perhaps in Branchipus (Fig.
  <a href="#fig10">10</a>) and Apus (Fig. <a href="#fig9">9</a>), just as the nearest approach to
  the Eurypterid <span class="pagenum" id="page27">{27}</span>form is Limulus. Crustaceans such as
  crabs and lobsters are of much later origin, and do not occur in any quantity until the late
  Mesozoic period. The earliest found, a kind of prawn, occurs in the Carboniferous age.</p>

  <p>Korschelt and Heider have accordingly suggested the name <i>Pal√¶ostraca</i> for this whole
  group, and <i>Protostraca</i> for the still earlier <span class="pagenum"
  id="page28">{28}</span>arthropod-like animals which gave origin to the trilobites themselves. This
  name I shall adopt, and speak, therefore, of the <i>Pal√¶ostraca</i> as the dominant race at the
  time when vertebrates first appeared.</p>

  <p>If, then, there is no break in the law of evolution here, the race which was predominant at the
  time when the vertebrate first appeared must have been that from which the first fishes arose, and
  these fishes must have resembled, not the crustacean proper, or the arachnid proper, but a member
  of the pal√¶ostracan group. Moreover, just as the Labyrinthodonts show special affinities to the
  fishes which were then living, so we should expect that the forms of the earliest fish would
  resemble the arthropodan type dominant at the time more closely than the fish of a later era.</p>

  <p>At first sight it seems too great an absurdity even to imagine the possibility of any genetic
  connection between a fish and an arthropod, for to the mind's eye there arises immediately the
  picture of a salmon or a shark and a lobster or a spider. So different in appearance are the two
  groups of animals, so different their methods of locomotion, that it is apparently only an inmate
  of a lunatic asylum who could possibly suggest such a connection. Much more likely is it that a
  fish-like form should have been developed out of a smooth, wriggling, worm-like animal, and it is
  therefore to the annelids that the upholders of the theory of the reversal of surfaces look for
  the ancestor of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>We must endeavour to dismiss from our imagination such forms as the salmon and shark as
  representatives of the fish-tribe, and the lobster and spider of the arthropods, and try to
  picture the kind of animals living in the seas in the early Devonian and Upper Silurian times, and
  then we find, to our surprise, that instead of the contrast between fishes and arthropods being so
  striking as to make any comparison between the two seem an absurdity, the difficulty in the last
  century, and even now, is to decide in many cases whether a fossil is an arthropod or a fish.</p>

  <p>I have shown what kind of animal the pal√¶ostracan was like. What information is there of the
  nature of the earliest vertebrate?</p>

  <p>The most ancient fishes hitherto discovered have been classified by Lankester and Smith
  Woodward into the three orders, Heterostraci, Osteostraci, and Antiarcha. Of these the
  Heterostraci contain the genera Pteraspis and Cyathaspis, and are the very earliest vertebrates
  yet discovered, being found in the Lower Silurian. The Osteostraci are divided into the
  Cephalaspid√¶, Tremataspid√¶, etc., and are found in the Upper Silurian and Devonian beds. The
  Antiarcha, comprising Pterichthys and Bothriolepis, belong to the Devonian and are not found in
  Silurian deposits. This, then, is the order of their appearance&mdash;Pteraspis, Cephalaspis, and
  Pterichthys.</p>

  <p>In none of these families is there any resemblance to an ordinary fish. In no case is there any
  sign of vertebr√¶ or of jaws. They, like the lampreys, were all agnathostomatous. Strange indeed is
  their appearance, and it is no wonder that there should have been a difficulty in deciding whether
  they were fish or arthropod. Their great characteristic is their buckler-plated cephalic shield,
  especially conspicuous on the dorsal side of the head. Figs. 11, 14, 15, 16, give the dorsal
  shields of Pteraspis, Auchenaspis, Pterichthys, and Bothriolepis.</p>

  <p>In 1904, Drevermann discovered a mass of <i>Pteraspis Dunensis</i> embedded in a single stone,
  showing the same kind of head-shield as <i>P. rostrata</i>, but the rostrum was longer and the
  spine at the extremity of the head-shield much longer and more conspicuous. The whole shape of the
  animal as seen in this photograph recalls the shape of a Hemiaspid rather than of a fish. It is,
  then, natural enough for the earlier observers to have looked upon such a fossil as related to an
  arthropod rather than a fish.</p>

  <p>In a later chapter I propose to discuss the peculiarities and the nature of the head-shields of
  these earliest fishes, in connection with the question of the affinities of the animals which bore
  them. At this point of my argument I want simply to draw attention to the undoubted fact of the
  striking similarity in appearance between the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page32">{32}</span>earliest fishes and members of the Pal√¶ostraca, the dominant race of
  arthropods which swarmed in the sea at the time: a similarity which could never have been
  suspected by any amount of investigation among living forms, but is immediately revealed when the
  ages themselves are questioned.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The argument, then, from geology, like that from comparative anatomy and from the
  consideration of the importance of the central nervous system in the upward development of the
  animal race, not only points directly to the arthropod group as the ancestor of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page33">{33}</span>vertebrate, but also to a distinct ancient type of
  arthropod, the Pal√¶ostracan, the only living example of which is the King-Crab or Limulus; while
  the nearest approach to the trilobite group among living arthropods are Branchipus and Apus. It
  follows, therefore, that for the following up of this clue, Limulus especially must be taken into
  consideration, while Branchipus and Apus are always to be kept in mind.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Ammoc&#x0153;tes rather than Amphioxus is the Best Subject for
  Investigation.</span></p>

  <p>It is not, however, Limulus that must be investigated in the first instance, but the vertebrate
  itself; for it can never be insisted on too often that in the vertebrate itself its past history
  will be found, but that Limulus cannot reveal the future of its race. What vertebrate must be
  chosen for investigation? Reasons have been given why our attention should be fixed upon the
  king-crab rather than on the lobster on the invertebrate side; what is the most likely animal on
  the vertebrate side?</p>

  <p>From the evidence already given it is manifest that the earliest mammal belonged to the lowest
  group of mammals; that the birds on their first appearance presented reptilian characteristics,
  that the earliest reptiles belonged to a low type of reptile, that the amphibians at their first
  appearance were nearer in type to the fishes than were the later forms. As each of these groups
  advances in number and power, specialization takes place in it, and the latest developed members
  become further and further removed in type from the earliest. So also it must have been with the
  origin of fishes: here too, in the quest for information as to the structure and nature of the
  first-formed fishes, we must look to the lowest rather than to the highest living members of the
  group.</p>

  <p>The lowest fish-like animal at present living is Amphioxus, and on this ground it is argued
  that the original vertebrate must have approached in organization to that of Amphioxus; it is upon
  the comparison between the structure of Amphioxus and that of Balanoglossus, that the theory of
  the origin of vertebrates from forms like the latter animal is based. For my own part, I think
  that in the first instance, at all events, Amphioxus should be put on one side, although of course
  its structure must always be kept in mind, for the following reasons<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page34">{34}</span></div>

  <p>Amphioxus, like the tunicates, does not possess the characteristics of other vertebrates. In
  all vertebrates above these forms the great characteristic is a well-defined brain-region from
  which arise nerves to organs of special sense, the eyes and nose. In Amphioxus no eyes exist, for
  the pigmented spot at the anterior extremity of the brain-region is no eye but only a mass of
  pigment, and the so-called olfactory pit is a very rudimentary and inferior organ of smell. In
  connection with the nearly complete absence of these two most important sense-organs, the most
  important part of the central nervous system, the region corresponding to the cerebral
  hemispheres, is also nearly completely absent.</p>

  <p>Now, the history of the evolution of the central nervous system in the animal race points
  directly to its formation as a concentrated mass of nervous material at the anterior extremity of
  the body, in consequence of the formation of special olfactory and visual organs at that
  extremity. As already stated, the concentration of nervous material around the mouth as an oral
  ring was its beginning. In connection with this there arose special sense-organs for the guidance
  of the animal to its food which took the form of olfactory and optic organs. With the shifting
  from the radial to the elongated form these sense-organs remained at the anterior or mouth-end of
  the animal, and owing to their immense importance in the struggle for existence, that part of the
  central nervous system with which they were connected developed more than any other part, became
  the leader to which the rest of the nervous system was subservient, and from that time onwards the
  development of the brain-region was inevitably associated with the upward progress of animal
  life.</p>

  <p>To those who believe in Evolution and the Darwinian theory of the survival of the fittest, it
  is simply inconceivable that a soft-bodied animal living in the mud, blind, with a rudimentary
  brain and rudimentary olfactory organs, such as is postulated when we think of Balanoglossus and
  Amphioxus, should hold its own and come victorious out of the struggle for existence at a time
  when the sea was peopled with powerful predaceous scorpion- and crab-like armour-plated animals
  possessing a well-developed brain, good eyes and olfactory organs, and powerful means of
  locomotion. Wherever in the scale of animal development Amphioxus may ultimately be placed, it
  cannot be looked upon as the type of the earliest formed fishes such as appeared in Silurian
  times.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page35">{35}</span></div>

  <p>The next lowest group of living fishes is the Marsipobranchii which include the lampreys and
  hag-fishes. To these naturally we must turn for a clue as to the organization of the earliest
  fish, for here we find all the characteristics of the vertebrates represented: a well-formed
  brain-region, well-developed eyes and nose, cranial nerves directly comparable with those of other
  vertebrates, and even the commencement of vertebr√¶.</p>

  <p>Among these forms the lamprey is by far the best for investigation, not only because it is
  easily obtainable in large quantities, but especially because it passes a large portion of its
  existence in a larval condition, from which it emerges into the adult state by a wonderful process
  of transformation, comparable in extent with the transformation of the larval caterpillar into the
  adult imago. So long does the lamprey live in this free larval condition, and so different is it
  in the adult stage, that the older anatomists considered that the two states were really different
  species, and gave the name of <i>Ammoc&#x0153;tes branchialis</i> to the larval stage, while the
  adult form was called <i>Petromyzon planeri</i>, or <i>Petromyzon fluviatilis</i>.</p>

  <p>This long-continued free-living existence in the larval or Ammoc&#x0153;tes stage makes the
  lamprey, more than any other type of lowly organized fish, invaluable for the present
  investigation, for throughout the animal kingdom it is recognized that the larval form approaches
  nearer to the ancestral type than the adult form, whether the latter is progressive or degenerate.
  Not only are the tissues formed during the stages which are passed through in a free-living larval
  form, serviceable tissues comparable to those of adult life, but also these stages proceed at so
  much slower a rate than do those in the embryo <i>in utero</i> or in the egg, as to make the
  larval form much more suitable than the embryo for the investigation of ancestral problems. It is
  true enough that the free life of the larva may bring about special adaptations which are not of
  an ancestral character, as may also occur during the life of the adult; but the evidence is very
  strong that although some of the peculiarities of the larva may be due to such c&#x0153;nogenetic
  factors, yet on the whole many of them are due to ancestral characters, which disappear when
  transformation takes place, and are not found in the adult.</p>

  <p>Thus if it be supposed that the amphibian arose from the fish, the tadpole presents more
  resemblance to the fish than the frog. If <span class="pagenum" id="page36">{36}</span>it be
  supposed that the arthropod arose from the segmented worm, the caterpillar bears out the
  suggestion better than the adult imago. If it be supposed that the tunicate arose from a stock
  allied to the vertebrate, it is because of the peculiarities of the larva that such a supposition
  is entertained. So, too, if it be supposed that the fish arose from a member of the arthropod
  group, the larval form of the fish is most likely to give decisive information on the point.</p>

  <p class="sp3">For all these reasons the lowest form of fish to be investigated, in the hopes of
  finding out the nature of the earliest formed fish, is not Amphioxus, but Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the
  larval form of the lamprey&mdash;a form which, as I hope to satisfy my reader after perusal of
  subsequent pages, more nearly resembles the ancient Cephalaspidian fishes than any other living
  vertebrate.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Comparison of Central Nervous Systems of Vertebrate and Arthropod
  without Reversal of Surfaces.</span></p>

  <p>So far different lines of investigation all point to the origin of the vertebrate from
  arthropods, the group of arthropods in question being now extinct, the nearest living
  representative being Limulus; also to the fact that of the two theories of the origin of
  vertebrates, that one which is based on the resemblance between the central nervous systems of the
  Vertebrata and the Appendiculata (Arthropoda and Annelida) is more in accordance with this
  evidence than the other, which is based mainly on the supposed possession of a notochord among
  certain animals.</p>

  <p>How is it, then, that this theory has been discredited and lost ground? Simply, I imagine,
  because it was thought to necessitate the turning over of the animal. Let us, then, again look at
  the nervous system of the vertebrate, and see whether there is any such necessity.</p>

  <p>As previously mentioned, the comparison of the two central nervous systems showed such close
  resemblances as to force those anatomists who supported this theory to the conclusion that the
  infundibular tube was in the position of the original &#x0153;sophagus; they therefore looked for
  the remains of a mouth opening in the dorsal roof of the brain, but did not attempt to explain the
  extraordinary fact that the infundibular tube is only a ventral offshoot from the tube of the
  central nervous system. Yet this latter tube <span class="pagenum" id="page37">{37}</span>is one,
  if not the most striking, of the peculiarities which distinguish the vertebrate; a tubular central
  nervous system such as that of the vertebrate is totally unlike any other nervous system, and the
  very fact that the two nervous systems of the vertebrate and arthropod are so similar in their
  nervous arrangements, makes it still more extraordinary that the nervous system should be grouped
  round a tube in the one case and not in the other.</p>

  <p>Now, in the arthropod the &#x0153;sophagus leads directly into the stomach, which is situated
  in the head-region, and from this a straight intestine passes directly along the length of the
  body to the anus, where it terminates. The relations of mouth, &#x0153;sophagus, alimentary canal,
  and nervous system in these animals are represented in the diagram (Fig. <a
  href="#fig3">3</a>).</p>

  <p>Any tube, therefore, such as that of the infundibulum, which would represent the
  &#x0153;sophagus of such an animal, must have opened into the mouth on the ventral side, and into
  the stomach on the dorsal side, and the lining epithelium of such an &#x0153;sophagus must have
  been continuous with that of the stomach, and so of the whole intestinal tract.</p>

  <p>Supposing, then, the animal is not turned over, but that the dorsal side still remains dorsal
  and ventral ventral, then the original mouth-opening of the &#x0153;sophagus must be looked for on
  the ventral surface of the vertebrate brain in the region of the pituitary body or hypophysis, and
  on the dorsal side the tube representing the &#x0153;sophagus must be continuous with a large
  cephalically dilated tube, which ought to pass into a small canal, to run along the length of the
  body and terminate in the anus.</p>

  <p>This is exactly what is found in the vertebrate, for the infundibular tube passes into the
  third ventricle of the brain, which forms, with the other ventricles of the brain, the large
  dilated cephalic portion of the so-called nerve tube, and at the junction of the medulla oblongata
  and spinal cord, this dilated anterior part passes into the small, straight, central canal of the
  spinal cord, which in the embryo terminates in the anus by way of the neurenteric canal. If the
  animal is regarded as not having been turned over, then the conclusion that the infundibulum was
  the original &#x0153;sophagus leads immediately to the further conclusion that the ventricles of
  the vertebrate brain represent the original cephalic stomach, and the central canal of the spinal
  cord the straight intestine of the arthropod ancestor.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page38">{38}</span></div>

  <p>For the first time a logical, straightforward explanation is thus given of the peculiarities of
  the tube of the central nervous system, with its extraordinary termination in the anus in the
  embryo, its smallness in the spinal cord, its largeness in the brain region, and its offshoot to
  the ventral side of the brain as the infundibular channel. It is so clear that, if the
  infundibular tube be looked on as the old &#x0153;sophagus, then its lining epithelium is the
  lining of that &#x0153;sophagus; and the fact that this lining epithelium is continuous with that
  of the third ventricle, and so with the lining of the whole nerve-tube, must be taken into account
  and not entirely ignored as has hitherto been the case. If, then, we look at the central nervous
  system of the vertebrate in the light of the central nervous system of the arthropod without
  turning the animal over, we are led immediately to the conclusion that what has hitherto been
  called the vertebrate nervous system is in reality composed of two parts, viz. a nervous part
  comparable in all respects with that of the arthropod ancestor, which has grown over and included
  into itself, to a greater or less extent, a tubular part comparable in all respects with the
  alimentary canal of the aforesaid ancestor. If this conclusion is correct, it is entirely wrong to
  speak of the vertebrate central nervous system as being tubular, for the tube does not belong to
  the nervous system, but was originally a simple epithelial tube, such as characterizes the
  &#x0153;sophagus, cephalic stomach, and straight intestine of the arthropod.</p>

  <p>Here, then, is the crux of the position&mdash;either the so-called nervous tube of the
  vertebrate is composed of two separate factors, consisting of a true non-tubular nervous system
  and a non-nervous epithelial tube, these two elements having become closely connected together; or
  it is composed of one factor, an epithelial tube which constitutes the nervous system, its
  elements being all nervous elements.</p>

  <p>If this latter hypothesis be accepted, then it is necessary to explain why parts of that tube,
  such as the roof of the fourth ventricle, the choroid plexuses of the various ventricles, which
  are parts of the original roof inserted into the ventricles, are not composed of nervous material,
  but form simple single-layered epithelial sheets, which by no possibility can be included among
  functional nervous structures. The upholders of this hypothesis can only explain the nature of
  these thin epithelial parts of the nervous tube in one of two ways; either the tube was originally
  formed of nervous <span class="pagenum" id="page39">{39}</span>material throughout, and for some
  reason parts of it have lost their nervous function and thinned down; or else these thin
  epithelial parts are on their way to become nervous material, are still in an embryonic condition,
  and are of the nature of epiblast-epithelium, from which the central nervous system originally
  arose.</p>

  <p>The first explanation is said to be supported by embryology, for at first the nerve-tube is
  formed in a uniform manner, and then later, parts of the roof appear to thin out and so form the
  thin epithelial parts. If this were the right explanation, then it ought to be found that in the
  lowest vertebrates there is greater evidence of a uniformly nervous tube than in the higher
  members of the group: while conversely, if, on the contrary, as we descend the vertebrate phylum,
  it is found that more and more of the tube presents the appearance of a single layer of
  epithelium, and the nervous material is limited more and more to certain parts of that tube, then
  the evidence is strong that the tubular character of the central nervous system is not due to an
  original nervous tube, but to a non-nervous epithelial tube with which the original nervous system
  has become closely connected.</p>

  <p>The comparison of the brain region of the different groups of vertebrates (Fig. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>) is most instructive, for it demonstrates in the most conclusive manner how
  the roof of the nervous tube in that region loses more and more its nervous character, and takes
  on the appearance of a simple epithelial tube, as we descend lower and lower; until at last, in
  the brain of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, as represented in the figures, the whole of the brain-roof, from
  the region of the pineal eye to the commencement of the spinal cord, is composed of fold upon fold
  of a thin epithelial membrane forming an epithelial bag, which is constricted in only one place,
  where the fourth cranial nerve crosses over it.</p>

  <p>Further, the brain of Ammoc&#x0153;tes (Fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a>) shows clearly not only
  that it is composed of two parts, an epithelial tube and a nervous system, but also that the
  nerve-masses are arranged in the same relative position with respect to this tube as are the
  nerve-masses in the invertebrate with respect to the cephalic stomach and &#x0153;sophagus. This
  evidence is so striking, so conclusive, that it is impossible to resist the conclusion that the
  tube did not originate as part of the central nervous system, but was originally independent of
  the central nervous system, and has been invaded by it.</p>

  <p>The second explanation is hardly worth serious consideration, for it supposes that the nervous
  system, for no possible reason, was laid down in its most important parts&mdash;the
  brain-region&mdash;as an epithelial tube with latent potential nervous functions; that even up to
  the highest vertebrate yet evolved these nervous functions are still in abeyance over the whole of
  the choroid plexuses and the roof of the fourth ventricle. Further, it supposes that this
  prophetic epithelial tube originally developed into true nervous material only in certain parts,
  and that these parts, curiously enough, formed a nervous system absolutely comparable to that of
  the arthropod, while the dormant prophetic epithelial part was formed so as just to mimic, in
  relation to the nervous part, the alimentary canal of that same arthropod.</p>

  <p>The mere facts of the case are sufficient to show the glaring absurdity of such an explanation.
  This is not the way Nature works; it is not consistent with natural selection to suppose that in a
  low form nervous material can be laid down as non-nervous epithelial material in order to provide
  in some future ages for the great increase in the nervous system.</p>

  <p>Every method of investigation points to the same conclusion, whether the method is
  embryological, anatomical, or pathological.</p>

  <p>First, take the embryological evidence. On the ground that the individual development
  reproduces to a certain extent the phylogenetic development, the peculiarities of the formation of
  the central nervous system in the vertebrate embryo ought to receive an appropriate explanation in
  any theory of phylogenetic development. Hitherto such explanation has been totally lacking; any
  suggestion of the manner in which a tubular nervous system may have been formed takes no account
  whatever of the differences between different parts of the tube; its dilated cephalic end with its
  infundibular projection ventrally, its small straight spinal part, and its termination in the
  anus. My theory, on the other hand, is in perfect harmony with the embryological history, and
  explains it point by point.</p>

  <p>From the very first origin of the central nervous system there is evidence of two
  structures&mdash;the one nervous, and the other an epithelial surface-layer which ultimately forms
  a tube; this was first described by Scott in Petromyzon, and later by Assheton in the frog. In the
  latter case the external epithelial layer is pigmented, while the underlying nervous layer
  contains no pigment; a marked <span class="pagenum" id="page43">{43}</span>and conspicuous
  demarcation exists, therefore, between the two layers from the very beginning, and it is easy to
  trace the subsequent fate of the two layers owing to this difference of pigmentation. The
  pigmented cells form the lining cells of the central canal, and becoming elongated, stretch out
  between the cells of the nervous layer; while the latter, on their side, invade and press between
  the pigmented cells. In this case, owing to the pigmentation of the epithelial layer, embryology
  points out in the clearest possible manner how the central nervous system of the vertebrate is
  composed of two structures&mdash;an epithelial non-nervous tube, on the outside of which the
  central nervous system was originally grouped; how, as development proceeds, the elements of these
  two structures invade each other, until at last they become so involved together as to give rise
  to the conception that we are dealing with one single nerve tube. It is impossible for embryology
  to give a clearer clue to the past history than it does in this case, for it actually shows, step
  by step, how the amalgamation between the central nervous system and the old alimentary canal took
  place.</p>

  <p>Further, consider the shape of the tube when it is first formed, how extraordinary and
  significant that is. It consists of a simple dilated anterior end leading into a straight tube,
  the lumen of which is much larger than that of the ultimate spinal canal, and terminates by way of
  the neurenteric canal in the anus.</p>

  <p>Why should the tube take this peculiar shape at its first formation? No explanation is given or
  suggested in any text-book of embryology, and yet it is so natural, so simple: it is simply the
  shape of the invertebrate alimentary canal with its cephalic stomach and straight intestine ending
  in the anus. Again embryology indicates most unmistakably the past history of the race. How are
  the nervous elements grouped round this tube when it is first formed? Here embryology shows that a
  striking difference exists between the part of the tube which forms the spinal cord and the
  dilated cephalic part. Fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>, A (2), represents the relation between the
  nervous masses and the epithelial tube in the first instance. At this stage the nervous material
  in the spinal cord lies laterally and ventrally to this tube, and at a very early stage the white
  anterior commissure is formed, joining together these two lateral masses; as yet there is no sign
  of any posterior fissure, the tube with its open lumen extends right to the dorsal surface.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page44">{44}</span></div>

  <p>The interpretation of this stage is that in the invertebrate ancestor the nerve-masses were
  situated laterally and ventrally to the epithelial tube, and were connected together by
  commissures on the ventral side of the tube (Fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>, A (1)); in other words,
  the chain of ventral ganglia and their transverse commissures lying just ventrally to the
  intestine, which are so characteristic of the arthropod nervous system, is represented at this
  stage.</p>

  <div class="ac w45 fcenter sp2">

      Ganglia and the Cephalic Stomach of an Arthropod.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Subsequently, by the growth dorsalwards of nervous material to form the posterior columns, the
  original epithelial tube is compressed dorsally and laterally to such an extent that those parts
  lose all signs of lumen, the one becoming the posterior fissure and the others the <i>substantia
  gelatinosa Rolandi</i> on each side. The original tube is thus reduced to a small canal formed by
  its ventral portion only (Fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>, A (3)). In this way the spinal cord is
  formed, and the walls of the original epithelial tube are finally visible only as the lining of
  the central canal (Fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>, A (4)).</p>

  <p>When we pass to the brain-region, to the anterior dilated portion of the tube, embryology tells
  a different story. Here, as in the spinal cord, the nervous masses are grouped at first laterally
  and ventrally to the epithelial tube, as is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>, B (2), but owing
  to the large size of its lumen here, the nervous material is not able to enclose it completely, as
  in the case of the spinal cord; <span class="pagenum" id="page45">{45}</span>consequently there is
  no posterior fissure formed; but, on the contrary, the dorsal roof, not enclosed by the
  nerve-masses, remains epithelial, and so forms the membranous roof of the fourth ventricle and of
  the other ventricles of the brain (Fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>, B (3)). In the higher animals,
  owing to the development of the cerebrum and cerebellum, this membranous roof becomes pushed into
  the larger brain cavity, and thus forms the choroid plexuses of the third and lateral ventricles.
  In the lower vertebrates, as in Ammoc&#x0153;tes and the Dipnoi, it still remains as a dorsal
  epithelial roof and forms a most striking characteristic of such brains.</p>

  <p>In this part of the nervous system, then, the nervous material is all grouped in its original
  position on the ventral side of the tube; and yet it is the same nervous material as that of the
  spinal cord, all the elements are there, giving origin here to the segmental cranial nerves just
  as lower down they give rise to the segmental spinal nerves, connecting together the separate
  segments each with the other and all with the higher brain-centres&mdash;the supra-infundibular
  centres&mdash;just as they do in the spinal region.</p>

  <p>Why should there be this striking difference between the formation of the infra-infundibular
  region of the brain and that of the spinal cord? Do the advocates of the origin of vertebrates
  from Balanoglossus give the slightest reason for it? They claim that their view also provides a
  tubular nervous system for the vertebrate, but give not the slightest sign or indication as to why
  the nervous material should be grouped entirely on the ventral side of an epithelial tube in the
  infra-infundibular region and yet surround it in the spinal cord region. And the explanation is so
  natural, so simple: embryology does its very best to tell us the past history of the race, if only
  we look at it the right way.</p>

  <p>The infra-infundibular nervous mass is naturally confined to the ventral side of the epithelial
  tube, because it represents the infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, situated as they are on the
  ventral side of the cephalic stomach, and, owing to the size of the stomach, they could not
  enclose it by dorsal growth, as they do in the case of the formation of the spinal cord (Fig. <a
  href="#fig21">21</a>, B (1)). Still these nervous masses have grown dorsalwards, have commenced to
  involve the walls of the cephalic stomach even in the lowest vertebrate, as is seen in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, in which animal a ventral portion of the epithelial bag has been evidently
  compressed and its lumen finally obliterated <span class="pagenum" id="page46">{46}</span>by the
  growth of the nerve-masses on each side of it. Throughout the whole vertebrate kingdom this
  obliterated portion still leaves its mark as the <i>raph√©</i> or seam, which is so characteristic
  of the infra-infundibular portion of the brain.</p>

  <div class="ac w25 fcenter sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here, again, it is seen how simple is the explanation of a peculiarity which has always puzzled
  anatomists&mdash;why should there be this seam in the infra-infundibular portion of the brain and
  not in the supra-infundibular or in the spinal cord? The corresponding compression in the upper
  brain-region forms the lateral ventricles, as is seen in the accompanying figure of the brain of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes (Fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a>).</p>

      Bird.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In yet another instance it is seen how markedly the nervous masses are arranged in the same
  position with respect to the central tube as are the nerve ganglia with respect to the intestinal
  tube in the case of the invertebrate. Thus in birds a portion of the spinal cord in the
  lumbo-sacral region presents a very different appearance from the rest of the cord; it is known as
  the rhomboidal sinus, and a section of the cord of an adult pigeon across this region is given in
  Fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>. As is seen, the nervous portions are entirely confined to two masses
  connected together by the white anterior commissures which are situated laterally and ventrally to
  a median gelatinous mass; the small central canal is visible and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page47">{47}</span>the whole dorsal area of the cord is taken up by a peculiar non-nervous
  wedge-shaped mass of tissue. At its first formation this portion of the cord is formed exactly in
  the same manner as the rest of the cord; instead, however, of the nervous material invading the
  dorsal part of the tube to form the posterior fissure, it has been from some cause unable to do
  so, the walls of the original non-nervous tube have become thickened dorsally, been transformed
  into this peculiar tissue, and so caused the peculiar appearance of the cord here. The nervous
  parts have not suffered in their development; the mechanism for walking in the bird is as well
  developed as in any other animal; their position only is different, for they still retain the
  original ventro-lateral position, but the non-nervous tube, the remains of the old intestine, has
  undergone a peculiar gelatinous degeneration just where it has remained free from invasion by the
  nervous tissue.</p>

  <p>Throughout the whole of that part of the nervous system which gives origin to the cranial and
  spinal segmental nerves, the evidence is absolutely uniform that the nervous material was
  originally arranged bilaterally and ventrally on each side of the central tube, exactly in the
  same way as the nerve-masses of the infra-&#x0153;sophageal and ventral chain of ganglia are
  arranged with respect to the cephalic stomach and straight intestine of the arthropod. But, in
  addition, we find in the vertebrate nervous masses, the cerebral hemispheres, the corpora
  quadrigemina and the cerebellum situated on the dorsal side of the central tube in the
  brain-region; this nervous material is, however, of a different character to that which gives
  origin to the spinal and cranial segmental nerves. How is the presence of these dorsal masses to
  be explained on the supposition that the dilated anterior part of the nerve-tube was originally
  the cephalic stomach of the arthropod ancestor? The cerebral hemispheres are simple enough, for
  they represent the supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, which of necessity, as they increased in size,
  would grow round the anterior end of the cephalic stomach and become more and more dorsal in
  position.</p>

  <p>The difficulty lies rather in the position of the cerebellum and corpora quadrigemina, and the
  solution is as simple as it is conclusive.</p>

  <p>Let us again turn to embryology and see what help it gives. In all vertebrates the dilated
  anterior portion of the nerve-tube does not, <span class="pagenum" id="page48">{48}</span>as it
  grows, increase in size uniformly, but a constriction appears on its dorsal surface at one
  particular place, so as to divide it into an anterior and posterior vesicle; then the latter
  becomes divided into two portions by a second constriction. In this way three cerebral vesicles
  are formed; these three primary cerebral vesicles indicate the region of the fore-brain,
  mid-brain, and hind-brain respectively. Subsequently the first cerebral vesicle becomes divided
  into two to form the prosencephalon and thalamencephalon, while the third cerebral vesicle is also
  divided into two to form the region of the cerebellum and medulla oblongata.</p>

  <p>These constrictions are in the position of commissural bands of nervous matter; of these the
  limiting nervous strands between the thalamencephalon and mesencephalon and between the
  mesencephalon and the hind-brain are of primary importance. The first of these commissural bands
  is in the position of the posterior commissure connecting the two optic thalami. In close
  connection with this are found, on the mid-dorsal region, the two pineal eyes with their optic
  ganglia, the so-called <i>ganglia habenul√¶</i>. From these ganglia a peculiar tract of fibre,
  known as Meynert's bundle, passes on each side to the ventral infra-infundibular portion of the
  brain. In other words, the first constriction of the dilated tube is due to the presence and
  growth of nervous material in connection with the median pineal eyes. Here in precisely the same
  spot, as will be fully explained in the next chapter, there existed in the arthropod ancestor a
  pair of median eyes situated dorsally to the cephalic stomach, the pre-existence of which explains
  the reason for the first constriction.</p>

  <p>The second primary constriction separating the mid-brain from the hind-brain is still more
  interesting, for it is coincident with the position of the trochlear or fourth cranial nerve. In
  all vertebrates without exception this nerve takes an extraordinary course; all other nerves,
  whether cranial or spinal, pass ventralwards to reach their destination. This nerve passes
  dorsalwards, crosses its fellow mid-dorsally in the valve of Vieussens, where the roof of the
  brain is thin, and then passes out to supply the superior oblique muscle of the eye of the
  opposite side. The two nerves form an arch constricting the dilated tube at this place. In the
  lowest vertebrate (Ammoc&#x0153;tes) the constriction formed by this nerve-pair is evident not
  only in the embryonic condition as in other vertebrates, but during the whole larval stage. As
  Fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a>, A and B, shows, the whole of the dorsal <span class="pagenum"
  id="page49">{49}</span>region of the brain up to the region of the pineal eye and <i>ganglion
  habenul√¶</i> is one large membranous bag, except for the single constriction where the fourth
  nerve on each side crosses over. The explanation of this peculiarity is given in Chapter VII., and
  follows simply from the facts of the arrangement of that musculature in the scorpion-group which
  gave rise to the eye-muscles of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>In Ammoc&#x0153;tes both cerebellum and posterior corpora quadrigemina can hardly be said to
  exist, but upon transformation a growth of nervous material takes place in this region, and it is
  seen that this commencing cerebellum and the corpora quadrigemina arise from tissue that is
  present in Ammoc&#x0153;tes along the course of the fourth nerve.</p>

  <p>Here, then, again Embryology does its best to tell us how the vertebrate arose. The formation
  of the two primary constrictions in the dilated anterior vesicle whereby the brain is divided into
  fore-brain, mid-brain, and hind-brain is simply the representation ontogenetically of the two
  nerve-tracts which crossed over the cephalic stomach in the prevertebrate stage, in consequence of
  the mid-dorsal position of the pineal eyes and of the insertion of the original superior oblique
  muscles.</p>

  <p>The subsequent constriction by which the prosencephalon is separated from the thalamencephalon
  is in the position of the anterior commissure, that commissure which connects the two
  supra-infundibular nerve-masses, and is one of the first-formed commissures in every vertebrate.
  This naturally is simply the commissure between the two supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia; anterior
  to it, in the middle line, equally naturally, the anterior end of the old stomach wall still
  exists as the <i>lamina terminalis</i>.</p>

  <p>The other division in the hind-brain region, which separates the region of the cerebellum from
  the medulla oblongata, is due to the growth of the cerebellum, and indicates its posterior limit.
  In such an animal as the lamprey, where the cerebellum is only commencing, this constriction does
  not occur in the embryo.</p>

  <p>From such simple beginnings as are seen in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the higher forms of brain have
  been evolved, to culminate in that of man, in which the massive cerebrum and cerebellum conceals
  all sign of the dorsal membranous roof, those parts of the simple epithelial tube which still
  remain being tucked away into the cavities to form the various choroid plexuses.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page50">{50}</span></div>

  <p>In the whole evolution from the brain of Ammoc&#x0153;tes to that of man, the same process is
  plainly visible, viz. growth and extension of nervous material over the epithelial tube; extension
  dorsally and posteriorly of the supra-infundibular nervous masses (as seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>), combined with a dorsal growth of parts of the infra-infundibular nervous
  masses to form the cerebellum and posterior corpora quadrigemina.</p>

  <p>Especially instructive is the formation of the cerebellum. It consists at first of a small mass
  of nervous tissue accompanying the fourth nerve, then by the growth of that mass surrounding and
  constricting a fold of the membranous roof, the <i>worm</i> of the cerebellum is formed, as in the
  dog-fish. This very constriction causes the membrane to be thrown into a lateral fold on each
  side, as seen in Fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a>, and in the dog-fish the nervous material on each
  side, known as the fimbri√¶, is already commencing to grow from the ventral mass of the medulla
  oblongata to surround these lateral membranous folds. These <i>fimbri√¶</i> develop more and more
  in higher forms, and thus form the cerebellar hemispheres.</p>

  <p>Not only does comparative anatomy confirm the teachings of embryology, but also pathology gives
  its quota in the same direction.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>One of the striking facts about malformations and disease of the central nervous system is the
  frequency of cystic formations; <i>spina bifida</i> is a well-known instance. These cysts are
  merely epithelial non-nervous cysts formed from the epithelium of the central canal, difficult to
  understand if the whole nerve tube is one and entirely nervous, either actually or potentially,
  but natural and easy if we are really dealing with a simple epithelial tube on the outside of
  which the nervous material was originally grouped. The cystic formation belongs naturally enough
  to this tube, not to the nervous system.</p>

  <p>Again, where animals such as lizards have grown a new tail, owing to the breaking off of the
  original one, it is found that the central canal extends into this new tail for some distance, but
  not <span class="pagenum" id="page51">{51}</span>the nervous material surrounding it; all the
  nerves supplying the new tail arise from the uninjured spinal cord above, the central canal with
  its lining layer of epithelial cells alone grows into the new-formed appendage.</p>

  <p>To all intents and purposes the same thing is seen in the termination of the spinal cord in a
  bird-embryo; more and more, as the end of the tail is approached, does the nervous matter of the
  spinal cord grow less and less, until at last a naked central canal with its lining epithelium is
  alone left to represent the so-called nerve-tube.</p>

  <p>All these different methods of investigation lead irresistibly to the one conclusion that the
  tubular nature of the central nervous system has been caused by the central nervous system
  enclosing to a greater or less extent a pre-existing, non-nervous, epithelial tube.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This must always be borne strictly in mind. The problem, therefore, which presents
  itself is the comparison of these two factors separately, in order to find out the relationship of
  the vertebrate to the invertebrate. The nervous system without the tube must be compared to other
  nervous systems, and the tube must be considered apart from the nervous system.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Principle of Concentration and Cephalization.</span></p>

  <p>The central nervous system of the vertebrate resembles that of all the Appendiculata in the
  fact that it is composed of segments joined together which give origin to segmental nerves. There
  is, however, a great difference between the two systems: the division into separate segments is
  not obvious to the eye in the vertebrate nervous system, while in the invertebrate we can see that
  it is composed of a series of separate pairs of ganglia joined together longitudinally by nervous
  strands known as connectives and transversely by the nerve-commissures. Such a simple segmented
  system is found in the segmented worms, and in the lower arthropods, such as Branchipus, no great
  advance has been made on that of the annelid. In the higher forms, however, a greater and greater
  tendency to fusion of separate ganglia exists, especially in the head-region, so that the
  infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, which, in the lower forms are as separate as those of the ventral
  chain, in the higher forms are fused together to form a single nervous mass.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page52">{52}</span></div>

  <p>This is the great characteristic of the advancement of the central nervous system among the
  Invertebrata, its concentration in the region of the head. It may be called the principle of
  cephalization, and is characteristic not only of higher organization in a group, but also of the
  adult as distinguished from the larval form. Thus in the imago greater concentration is found than
  in the caterpillar.</p>

  <p>The segmented annelid type of nervous system consists of a supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglion,
  composed of the fused ganglia belonging to the pre-oral segments, and an infra-&#x0153;sophageal
  chain of separate ganglia. With the concentration and modification around the mouth of the most
  anterior locomotor appendages to form organs for prehension and mastication of food, a
  corresponding concentration and fusion of the ganglia belonging to these segments takes place, so
  that finally, in the higher annelids, and in most of the great arthropod group, a fusion of a
  number of the most anterior ganglia has taken place to form the infra-&#x0153;sophageal
  ganglion-mass.</p>

  <p>The infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia which are the first to fuse are those which supply the most
  anterior portion of the animal with nerves, and include always those anterior appendages which are
  modified for mastication purposes. To this part the name <i>prosoma</i> has been given; in many
  cases it forms a well-defined, distinct portion of the animal.</p>

  <p>Succeeding this prosoma or masticatory region, there occurs in all gill-bearing arthropods a
  respiratory region, in many cases more or less distinctly defined, which has received the name of
  <i>mesosoma.</i> The rest of the body is called the <i>metasoma</i>.</p>

  <p>In accordance with this nomenclature the central nervous system of many of the Arthropoda may
  be divided as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1.  Pre-oral, or supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia.</p>

  <p>2.  Infra-oral, or infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia and ventral chain, which consist of three
  groups: prosomatic, mesosomatic, and metasomatic ganglia.</p>

  <p>The infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglion-mass, then, in most of the Arthropoda may be spoken of as
  formed by the fusion of the prosomatic or mouth-ganglia, the mesosomatic and metasomatic remaining
  separate and distinct. The number of ganglia which have fused may be observed by examination of
  the embryo, in which it is easy to see indications of the individual ganglia or <i>neuromeres</i>,
  although all such indication has disappeared in the adult; thus the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page53">{53}</span>infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia of the cray-fish have been shown to be
  constituted of six prosomatic ganglia.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a> I give figures of the central nervous system (with the
  exception of the abdominal or metasomatic ganglia) of Branchipus, Astacus, Limulus, Scorpio,
  Androctonus, Thelyphonus, and Ammoc&#x0153;tes. In all the figures the supra-&#x0153;sophageal
  ganglia are lined horizontally, and their nerves shown, viz. optic (lateral eyes (II) and median
  eyes (II&prime;)), olfactory (I) (first antenn√¶, camerostome, nose); then come the prosomatic
  ganglia (dotted), with their nerves (A) supplying the mouth parts, and the second antenn√¶ or
  chelicer√¶; then the mesosomatic (lined horizontally), with their nerves (B) supplying respiratory
  appendages. These figures show that the concentrated brain mass around the &#x0153;sophagus of an
  arthropod which has arrived at the stage of Astacus, is represented by the supra-&#x0153;sophageal
  ganglia and the fused prosomatic ganglia.</p>

  <p>The next stage in the evolution of the brain is seen in the gradual inclusion of the
  mesosomatic ganglia, one after the other, into the infra-&#x0153;sophageal mass of the already
  fused prosomatic ganglia. With this fusion is associated the loss of locomotion in these
  mesosomatic appendages, and their entire subservience to the function of respiration. Dana urges
  that cephalization is a consequence of functional alteration in the appendages, from organs of
  locomotion to those of mastication and respiration. Whether this be true or not, it is certainly a
  fact that in Limulus, the ganglion supplying the first mesosomatic appendage has fused with the
  prosomatic, infra-&#x0153;sophageal mass. It is also a fact that the prosomatic appendages are the
  organs of mastication, their basal parts being arranged round the mouth so as to act as foot-jaws,
  while the mesosomatic appendages, though still free to move, have been reduced to such an extent
  as to consist mainly of their basal parts, which are all respiratory in function, except in the
  case of the first pair, where they carry the terminal ducts of the genital organs. In the next
  stage, that, of the scorpion, in which the mesosomatic appendages have lost all power of free
  locomotion, and have become internal branchi√¶, another mesosomatic ganglion has fused with the
  brain mass, while in Androctonus two of the branchial mesosomatic ganglia have fused; and finally,
  in Thelyphonus and Phrynus, all the mesosomatic ganglia have coalesced with the fused prosomatic
  ganglia, while the metasomatic ganglia have themselves fused together in the caudal region to form
  what is known as the caudal brain.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page55">{55}</span></div>

  <p>The brain in these animals may be spoken of as composed of three parts&mdash;(1) the fused
  supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, (2) the fused prosomatic ganglia, and (3) the fused mesosomatic
  ganglia. Such a brain is strictly homologous with the vertebrate brain, which also is built up of
  three parts&mdash;(1) the part in front of the notochord, the prechordal or supra-infundibular
  brain, which consists of the cerebral hemispheres, together with the basal and optic ganglia and
  corresponds, therefore, to the supra-&#x0153;sophageal mass, with its olfactory and optic
  divisions lying in front of the &#x0153;sophagus; (2 and 3) the epichordal brain, composed of (2)
  a trigeminal and (3) a vagus division, of which the first corresponds strictly to the fused
  prosomatic ganglia, and the second to the fused mesosomatic ganglia. Further, just as in the
  embryo of an arthropod it is possible, with more or less accuracy, to see the number of neuromeres
  or original ganglia which have fused to form the supra- and infra-&#x0153;sophageal portions of
  its brain, so also in the embryo of a vertebrate we are able at an early stage to gain an
  indication, more or less accurate, of the number of neuromeres which have built up the vertebrate
  brain. The further consideration of these neuromeres, and the evidence they afford as to the
  number of the prosomatic and mesosomatic ganglia which have formed the epichordal part of the
  vertebrate brain, must be left to the chapter on the segmentation of the cranial nerves.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The further continuation of this process of concentration of separate segments,
  together with the fusion of the nervous system with the tube of the alimentary canal, leads in the
  simplest manner to the formation of the spinal cord of the vertebrate from the metasomatic ganglia
  of the ventral chain of the arthropod.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Antagonism between Cephalization and Alimentation.</span></p>

  <p>This concentration of the nervous system in the head-region, together with an actual increase
  in the bulk of the cephalic nervous masses, constitutes the great principle upon which the law of
  upward progress or evolution in the animal kingdom is based, and it illustrates in a striking
  manner the blind way in which natural selection works; for, as already explained, the central
  nervous system arose as a ring round the mouth, in consequence of which, with the progressive
  <span class="pagenum" id="page56">{56}</span>evolution of the animal kingdom, the &#x0153;sophagus
  necessarily pierced the central nervous system at the cephalic end. At the same time, the very
  fact that the evolution was progressive necessitated the concentration and increase of the nervous
  masses in this very same &#x0153;sophageal region.</p>

  <p>Progress on these lines must result in a crisis, owing to the inevitable squeezing out of the
  food-channel by the increasing nerve-mass; and, indeed, the fact that such a crisis had in all
  probability arisen at the time when vertebrates first appeared is apparent when we examine the
  conditions at the present time.</p>

  <p>Those invertebrates whose central nervous system is most concentrated at the cephalic end
  belong to the arachnid group, among which are included the various living scorpion-like animals,
  such as Thelyphonus, Androctonus, etc.</p>

  <p>As already mentioned, the giants of the Pal√¶ostracan age were Pterygotus, Slimonia, etc., all
  animals of the scorpion-type&mdash;in fact, sea-scorpions. Now, all these animals, spiders and
  scorpions, without exception, are blood-suckers, and in all of them the concentrated cephalic mass
  of nervous material surrounds an &#x0153;sophagus the calibre of which is so small that nothing
  but a fluid pabulum can be taken into the alimentary canal; and even for that purpose a special
  suctorial apparatus has in some species been formed on the gastric side of the &#x0153;sophagus
  for the purpose of drawing blood through this exceedingly narrow tube.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a> this increasing antagonism between brain-power and
  alimentation, as we pass from such a form as Branchipus to the scorpion, is illustrated, and in
  Fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a> the relative sizes of the &#x0153;sophagus and the brain-mass
  surrounding it is shown. The section shows that the food channel is surrounded by the white and
  grey matter of the brain as completely as the central canal of the spinal cord of the vertebrate
  is surrounded by the white and grey nervous material.</p>

  <p>Truly, at the time when vertebrates first appeared, the direction and progress of variation in
  the Arthropoda was leading, owing to the manner in which the brain was pierced by the
  &#x0153;sophagus, to a terrible dilemma&mdash;either the capacity for taking in food without
  sufficient intelligence to capture it, or intelligence sufficient to capture food and no power to
  consume it.</p>

  <p>Something had to be done&mdash;some way had to be found out of this difficulty. The atrophy of
  the brain meant degeneration and the reduction to a lower stage of organization, as is seen in the
  Tunicata. The further development of the brain necessitated the establishment of a new method of
  alimentation and the closure of the old &#x0153;sophagus, its vestiges still remaining as the
  infundibular canal of the vertebrate, meant the enormous upward stride of the formation of the
  vertebrate.</p>

  <p>At first sight it might appear too great an assumption even to imagine the possibility of the
  formation of a new gut in an animal so highly organized as an arthropod, but a little
  consideration will, I think, show that such is not the case.</p>

  <p>In the higher animals we are accustomed to speak of certain organs as vital and necessary for
  the further existence of the animal; these are essentially the central nervous system, the
  respiratory system, the circulatory system, and the digestive system. Of these four vital systems
  the first cannot be touched without the chance of degeneration; but that is not the case with the
  second. The passage from the fish to the amphibian, from the water-breathing to the air-breathing
  animal, has actually taken place, and was effected by the modification of the swim-bladder to form
  new respiratory organs&mdash;the lung; the old respiratory organs&mdash;the gills&mdash;becoming
  functionless, but still persisting in the embryo as vestiges. The necessity arose in consequence
  of the passage of the animal from water to land, and with this necessity nature found a means of
  overcoming the difficulty; air-breathing vertebrates arose, and from the very fact of their being
  able to extend over the land-surfaces, increased in numbers and developed in complexity in the
  manner already sketched out.</p>

  <p>For a respiratory system all that is required is an arrangement <span class="pagenum"
  id="page58">{58}</span>by means of which blood should be brought to the surface, so as to
  interchange its gases with those of the external medium; and it is significant to find that of all
  vertebrates the Amphibia alone are capable of an effective respiration by means of the skin.</p>

  <p>As to the circulatory system, it is exceedingly easily modified. An animal such as Amphioxus
  has no heart; in some the heart is systemic, in others branchial; in some there are more than one
  heart; in others there are contractile veins in addition to a heart. There is no difficulty here
  in altering and modifying the system according to the needs of the individual.</p>

  <p>For a digestive system all that is required is an arrangement for the digestion and absorption
  of food, a mechanism which can arise easily if some of the cells of the skin possess digestive
  power. Now Miss Alcock has shown that some of the surface-cells of crustaceans secrete a fluid
  which possesses digestive powers, and she has also shown that certain of the cells in the skin of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes possess digestive power.</p>

  <p>The difficulty, then, of forming a new digestive system in the passage from the arthropod to
  the vertebrate is very much the same as the difficulty in forming a new respiratory system in the
  passage from the water-breathing fish to the air-breathing amphibian&mdash;a change which does not
  strike us as inconceivable, because we know it has taken place.</p>

  <p>The whole argument so far leads to the conclusion that vertebrates arose from ancient forms of
  arthropods by the formation of a new alimentary canal, and the enclosure of the old canal by the
  growing central nervous system. If this conclusion is true, then it follows that we possess a
  well-defined starting-point from which to compare the separate organs of the arthropod with those
  of the vertebrate, and if, in consequence of such working hypothesis, each organ of the arthropod
  is found in the vertebrate in a corresponding position and of similar structure, then the truth of
  the starting-point is proved as fully as can possibly be expected by deductive methods. It is, in
  fact, this method of comparative anatomy which has proved the descent of man from the ape, the
  frog from the fish, etc.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Let us, then, compare all the organs of such a low vertebrate as Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  with those of an arthropod of the ancient type.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page59">{59}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Life History of the Lamprey&mdash;not a Degenerate
  Animal.</span></p>

  <p>The striking peculiarity of the lamprey is its life-history. It lives in fresh water, spending
  a large portion of its life in the mud during the period of its larval existence: then comes a
  somewhat sudden transformation-stage, characterized, as in the lepidopterous larva, by a process
  of histolysis, by which many of the larval tissues are destroyed and new ones formed, with the
  result that the larval lamprey, or Ammoc&#x0153;tes, is transformed into the adult lamprey, or
  Petromyzon. This transformation takes place in August, at all events in the neighbourhood of
  Cambridge, and later in the year the transformed lamprey migrates to the sea, grows in size and
  maturity, and returns to the river the following spring up to its spawning beds, where it spawns
  and forthwith dies. How long it lives in the Ammoc&#x0153;tes stage is unknown; I myself have kept
  some without transformation for four years, and probably they live in the rivers longer than that
  before they change from their larval state. It is absolutely certain that very much the longest
  part of the animal's life is spent in the larval stage, and that with the maturity of the sexual
  organs and the production of the fertilized ova the life of the individual ends.</p>

  <p>Now, the striking point of this transformation is that it produces an animal more nearly
  comparable with higher vertebrates than is the larval form; in other words, the transformation
  from larva to adult is in the direction of upward progress, not of degeneration. It is, therefore,
  inaccurate to speak of the adult lamprey as degenerate from a higher race of fishes represented by
  its larval form&mdash;Ammoc&#x0153;tes. Its transformation does not resemble that of the
  tunicates, but rather that of the frog, so that, just as in the case of the tadpole, the
  peculiarities of its larval form may be expected to afford valuable indications of its immediate
  ancestry. The very peculiarities to which attention must especially be paid are those discarded at
  transformation, and, as will be seen, these are essentially characteristic of the invertebrate and
  are not found in the higher vertebrates. In fact, the transformation of the lamprey from the
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes to the Petromyzon stage may be described as the casting off of many of its
  ancestral invertebrate characters and the putting on of the characteristics of the vertebrate
  type. It is this double individuality of the lamprey, together with its long-continued existence
  in the larval form, which makes Ammoc&#x0153;tes more <span class="pagenum"
  id="page60">{60}</span>valuable than any other living vertebrate for the study of the stock from
  which vertebrates sprang.</p>

  <p>Many authorities hold the view that the lamprey, like Amphioxus, must be looked upon as
  degenerate, and therefore as no more suitable for the investigation of the problem of vertebrate
  ancestry than is Amphioxus itself. This charge of degeneracy is based on the statement that the
  lamprey is a parasite, and that the eyes in Ammoc&#x0153;tes are under the skin. The whole
  supposition of the degeneracy of the Cyclostomata arose because of the prevailing belief of the
  time that the earliest fishes were elasmobranchs, and therefore gnathostomatous. From such
  gnathostomatous fishes the cyclostomes were supposed to have descended, having lost their jaws and
  become suctorial in habit in consequence of their parasitism.</p>

  <p>The charge of parasitism is brought against the lamprey because it is said to suck on to fishes
  and so obtain nutriment. It is, however, undoubtedly a free-swimming fish; and when we see it
  coming up the rivers in thousands to reach the spawning-beds, and sucking on to the stones on the
  way in order to anchor itself against the current, or holding on tightly during the actual process
  of spawning, it does not seem justifiable to base a charge of degeneration upon a parasitic habit,
  when such so-called habit simply consists in holding on to its prey until its desires are
  satisfied. If, of course, its suctorial mouth had arisen from an ancestral gnathostomatous mouth,
  then the argument would have more force.</p>

  <p>Dohrn, however, gives absolutely no evidence of a former <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'gnathostomotous'">gnathostomatous</span> condition either in Petromyzon or,
  in its larval state, Ammoc&#x0153;tes. He simply assumes that the Cyclostomata are degenerated
  fishes and then proceeds to point out the rudiments of skeleton, etc., which they still possess.
  Every point that Dohrn makes can be turned round; and, with more probability, it can be argued
  that the various structures are the commencement of the skeletal and other structures in the
  higher fishes, and not their degenerated remnants. Compare the life-history of the lamprey and of
  the tunicate. In the latter case we look upon the animal as a degenerate vertebrate, because the
  larval stage alone shows vertebrate characteristics; when transformation has taken place, and the
  adult form is reached, the vertebrate characteristics have vanished, and the animal, instead of
  reaching a higher grade, has sunk lower in the scale, the central nervous system especially having
  lost all <span class="pagenum" id="page61">{61}</span>resemblance to that of the vertebrate. In
  the former case a transformation also takes place, a marvellous transformation, characterized by
  two most striking facts. On the one hand, the resulting animal is more like a higher vertebrate,
  for, by the formation of new cartilages, its cranial skeleton is now comparable with that of the
  higher forms, and the beginnings of the spinal vertebr√¶ appear; by the increased formation of
  nervous material, its brain increases in size and complexity, so as to compare more closely with
  higher vertebrate brains; its eyes become functional, and its branchi√¶ are so modified,
  simultaneously with the formation of the new alimentary canal in the cranial region, that they now
  surround branchial pouches which are directly comparable to those of higher vertebrates. On the
  other hand, the transformation process is equally characterized by the throwing off of tissues and
  organs, one and all of which are comparable in structure and function with corresponding
  structures in the Arthropoda&mdash;the thyroid of the Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the tentacles, the
  muco-cartilage, the tubular muscles, all these structures, so striking in the Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  stage, are got rid of at transformation. Here is the true clue. Here, in the throwing off of
  invertebrate characters, and the taking on of a higher vertebrate form, especially a higher brain,
  not a lower one, Petromyzon proclaims as clearly as is possible that it is not a degenerate
  elasmobranch, but that it has arisen from Ammoc&#x0153;tes-like ancestors, even though Myxine,
  Amphioxus, and the tunicates be all stages on the downward grade from those same
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes-like ancestors.</p>

  <p class="sp3">As to the eyes, they are functional in the adult form and as serviceable as in any
  fish. There is no sign of degeneracy; it is only possible to speak of a retarded development which
  lasts through the larval stage.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Comparison of Brain of Ammoc&#x0153;tes with that of an
  Arthropod.</span></p>

  <p>Seeing that the steady progress of the development of the central nervous system is the most
  important factor in the evolution of animals, it follows that of all organs of the body, the
  central nervous system must be most easily comparable with that of the supposed ancestor. I will,
  therefore, start by comparing the brain of Ammoc&#x0153;tes with that of arthropods, especially of
  Limulus and of the scorpion-group.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page62">{62}</span></div>

  <p>The supra-infundibular portion of the brain in vertebrates corresponds clearly to the
  supra-&#x0153;sophageal portion of the invertebrate brain in so far that in both cases here is the
  seat of the will. Voluntary action is as impossible to the arthropod deprived of its
  supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia as to the vertebrate deprived of its cerebrum. It corresponds,
  also, in that from it arise the nerves of sight and smell and no other nerves; this is also the
  case with the supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, for from a portion of these ganglia arise the
  nerves to the eyes and the nerves to the first antenn√¶, of which the latter are olfactory in
  function. Thus, in the accompanying figure, taken from Bellonci, it is seen that the
  supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia consist of a superior segment corresponding to the cerebrum, a
  middle segment from which arise the nerves to the lateral eyes and to the olfactory antenn√¶,
  corresponding to the basal ganglia of the brain and the optic lobes, and, according to Bellonci,
  of an inferior segment from which arise the nerves to the second pair of antenn√¶. This last
  segment is not supra-&#x0153;sophageal in position, but is situated on the &#x0153;sophageal
  commissures. It has been shown by Lankester and Brauer in Limulus and the scorpion to be in
  reality the first ganglion of the infra-&#x0153;sophageal series, and not to belong to the
  supra-&#x0153;sophageal group.</p>

  <p>Further, in Limulus, in the scorpion-group, and in all the extinct <span class="pagenum"
  id="page63">{63}</span>Eurypterid√¶&mdash;in fact, in the Pal√¶ostraca generally&mdash;there are two
  median eyes in addition to the lateral eyes, which were innervated from these ganglia.</p>

  <p>In Ammoc&#x0153;tes, then, if the supra-infundibular portion of the brain really corresponds to
  the supra-&#x0153;sophageal of the pal√¶ostracan group, we ought to find, as indeed is the case, an
  optic apparatus consisting of two lateral eyes and two median eyes, innervated from the
  supra-infundibular brain-mass, and an olfactory apparatus built up on the same lines as in the
  scorpion-group, also innervated from this region. If, in addition, it be found that those two
  median eyes are degenerate eyes of the same type as the median eyes of Limulus and the
  scorpion-group, then the evidence is so strong as to amount to a proof of the correctness of the
  theory. This evidence is precisely what has been obtained in recent years, for the vertebrate did
  possess two median eyes in addition to the two lateral ones, and these two median eyes are
  degenerate eyes of the type found in the median eyes of arthropods and are not of the vertebrate
  type. Moreover, as ought also to be the case, they are most evident, and one of the pair is most
  nearly functional in the lowest perfect vertebrate, Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>Of all the discoveries made in recent years, the discovery that the pineal gland of the
  vertebrate brain was originally a pair of median eyes is by far the most important clue to the
  ancestry of the vertebrate, for not only do they correspond exactly in position with the median
  eyes of the invertebrates, but, being already degenerate and functionless in the lowest
  vertebrate, they must have been functional in a pre-vertebrate stage, thus giving the most direct
  clue possible to the nature of the pre-vertebrate stage. It is especially significant that in
  Limulus they are already partially degenerated. What, then, ought to be the structure and relation
  to the brain of the median and lateral eyes of the vertebrate if they originated from the
  corresponding organs of some one or other member of the pal√¶ostracan group?</p>

  <p class="sp3">This question will form the subject of the next chapter.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>The object of this book is to attempt to find out from what group of invertebrates the
    vertebrate arose; no attempt is made to speculate upon the causes of variation by means of which
    evolution takes place.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="page64">{64}</span></div>
    <p>A review of the animal kingdom as a whole leads to the conclusion that the upward development
    of animals from an original c&#x0153;lenterate stock, in which the central nervous system
    consists of a ring of nervous material surrounding the mouth, has led, in consequence of the
    elaboration of the central nervous system, to a general plan among the higher groups of
    invertebrates in the topographical arrangement of the important organs. The mouth is situated
    ventrally, and leads by means of the &#x0153;sophagus into an alimentary canal which is situated
    dorsally to the central nervous system. Thus the &#x0153;sophagus pierces the central nervous
    system and divides it into two parts, the supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia and the
    infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia. This is an almost universal plan among invertebrates, but
    apparently does not hold for vertebrates, for in them the central nervous system is always
    situated dorsally and the alimentary canal ventrally, and there is no piercing of the central
    nervous system by an &#x0153;sophagus.</p>
    <p>Yet a remarkable resemblance exists between the central nervous system of the vertebrate and
    that of the higher invertebrates, of so striking a character as to compel one school of
    anatomists to attempt the derivation of vertebrates from annelids. Now, the central nervous
    system of vertebrates forms a hollow tube, and a diverticulum of this hollow tube, known as the
    infundibulum, passes to the ventral surface of the brain in the very position where the
    &#x0153;sophagus would have been if that brain had belonged to an annelid or an arthropod. This
    school of anatomists therefore concluded that this infundibular tube represented the original
    invertebrate &#x0153;sophagus which had become closed and no longer opened into the alimentary
    canal owing to the formation of a new mouth in the vertebrate. As, however, the alimentary canal
    of the vertebrate is ventral to the central nervous system, and not dorsal, as in the
    invertebrate, it follows that the remains of the original invertebrate mouth into which the
    &#x0153;sophagus (in the vertebrate the infundibular tube) must have opened must be searched for
    on the dorsal side of the vertebrate; and so the theory was put forward that the vertebrate had
    arisen from the annelid by the reversal of surfaces, the back of the one animal becoming the
    front of the other.</p>
    <p>The difficulties in the way of accepting such reversal of surfaces have proved insuperable,
    and another school has arisen which suggests that evolution has throughout proceeded on two
    lines, the one forming groups of animals in which the central nervous system is pierced by the
    food-channel and the gut therefore lies dorsally to it, the other in which the central nervous
    system always lies dorsally to the alimentary canal and is not pierced by it. In both cases the
    highest products of the evolution have become markedly segmented animals, in the former,
    annelids and arthropods; in the latter, vertebrates. The only evidence on which such theory is
    based is the existence of low forms of animals, known as the <i>Enteropneusta</i>, the best
    known example of which is called <i>Balanoglossus</i>; they are looked upon as aberrant annelid
    forms by many observers.</p>
    <p>This theory does not attempt to explain the peculiarities of the tube of the vertebrate
    central nervous system, or to account for the extraordinary resemblance between the structure
    and arrangement of the central nervous systems of vertebrates and of the highest invertebrate
    group.</p>
    <p>Neither of these theories is satisfactory or has secured universal acceptance. The problem
    must be considered entirely anew. What are the guiding principles in this investigation?</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="page65">{65}</span></div>
    <p>The evolution of animal life on this earth can clearly, on the whole, be described as a
    process of upward progress culminating in the highest form&mdash;man; but it must always be
    remembered that whole groups of animals such as the Tunicata have been able to survive owing to
    a reverse process of degeneration.</p>
    <p>If there is one organ more than another which increases in complexity as evolution proceeds,
    which is the most essential organ for upward progress, surely it is the central nervous system,
    especially that portion of it called the brain. This consideration points directly to the origin
    of vertebrates from the most highly organized invertebrate group&mdash;the Arthropoda&mdash;for
    among all the groups of animals living on the earth in the present day they alone possess a
    central nervous system closely comparable with that of vertebrates. Not only has an upward
    progress taken place in animals as a whole, but also in the tissues themselves a similar
    evolution is apparent, and the evidence shows that the vertebrate tissues resemble more closely
    those of the arthropod than of any other invertebrate group.</p>
    <p>The evidence of geology points to the same conclusion, for the evidence of the rocks shows
    that before the highest mammal&mdash;man&mdash;appeared, the dominant race was the mammalian
    quadruped, from whom the highest mammal of all&mdash;man&mdash;sprung; then comes, in Mesozoic
    times, the age of reptiles which were dominant when the mammal arose from them. Preceding this
    era we find in Carboniferous times that the amphibian was dominant, and from them the next
    higher group&mdash;the reptiles&mdash;arose. Below the Carboniferous come the Devonian strata
    with their evidence of the dominance of the fish, from whom the amphibian was directly evolved.
    The evidence is so clear that each succeeding higher form of vertebrate arose from the highest
    stage reached at the time, as to compel one to the conclusion that the fishes arose from the
    race which was dominant at the time when the fishes first appeared. This brings us to the
    Silurian age, in which the evidence of the rocks points unmistakably to the sea-scorpions,
    king-crabs, and trilobites as being the dominant race. It was preceded by the great trilobite
    age, and the whole period, from the first appearance of the trilobite to the time of dwindling
    away of the sea-scorpions, may be designated the Pal√¶ostracan age, using the term Pal√¶ostraca to
    include both trilobites and the higher scorpion and king-crab forms evolved from them. The
    evidence of geology then points directly and strongly to the origin of vertebrates from the
    Pal√¶ostraca&mdash;arthropod forms which were not crustacean and not arachnid, but gave origin
    both to the modern-day crustaceans and arachnids. The history of the rocks further shows that
    these ancient fishes, when they first appeared, resembled in a remarkable manner members of the
    pal√¶ostracan group, so that again and again pal√¶ontologists have found great difficulty in
    determining whether a fossil is a fish or an arthropod. Fortunately, there is still alive on the
    earth one member of this remarkable group&mdash;the Limulus, or King-Crab. On the vertebrate
    side the lowest non-degenerate vertebrate is the lamprey, or Petromyzon, which spends a large
    portion of its existence in a larval stage, known as the Ammoc&#x0153;tes stage of the lamprey,
    because it was formerly considered to be a separate species and received the name of
    Ammoc&#x0153;tes. The larval stages of any animal are most valuable for the study of ancestral
    problems, so that it is most fortunate for the solution of the ancestry of vertebrates that
    Limulus on the one side and Ammoc&#x0153;tes on the other are <span class="pagenum"
    id="page66">{66}</span>available for thorough investigation and comparison. There are no
    trilobites still alive, but in Branchipus and Apus we possess the nearest approach to the
    trilobite organization among living crustaceans.</p>
    <p>So strongly do all these different lines of argument point to the origin of vertebrates from
    arthropods as to make it imperative to reconsider the position of that school of anatomists who
    derived vertebrates from annelids by reversing the back and front of the animal. Let us not turn
    the animal over, but re-consider the position, the infundibular tube of the vertebrate still
    representing the &#x0153;sophagus of the invertebrate, the cerebral hemispheres and basal
    ganglia the supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, the <i>crura cerebri</i> the &#x0153;sophageal
    commissures, and the infra-infundibular part of the brain the infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia.
    It is immediately apparent that just as the invertebrate &#x0153;sophagus leads into the large
    cephalic stomach, so the infundibular tube leads into the large cavity of the brain known as the
    third ventricle, which, together with the other ventricles, forms in the embryo a large anterior
    dilated part of the neural tube. In the arthropod this cephalic stomach leads into the straight
    narrow intestine; in the vertebrate the fourth ventricle leads into the straight narrow canal of
    the spinal cord. In the arthropod the intestine terminates in the anus; in the vertebrate embryo
    the canal of the spinal cord terminates in the anus by way of the neurenteric canal. Keep the
    animal unreversed, and immediately the whole mystery of the tubular nature of the central
    nervous system is revealed, for it is seen that the nervous matter, which corresponds bit by bit
    with that of the arthropod, has surrounded to a greater or less extent and amalgamated with the
    tube of the arthropod alimentary canal, and thus formed the so-called central nervous system of
    the vertebrate.</p>
    <p>The manner in which the nervous material has invaded the walls of the tube is clearly shown
    both by the study of the comparative anatomy of the central nervous system in the vertebrate and
    also by its development in the embryo.</p>
    <p class="sp0">This theory implies that the vertebrate alimentary canal is a new formation
    necessitated by the urgency of the case, and, indeed, there was cause for urgency, for the
    general plan of the evolution of the invertebrate from the c&#x0153;lenterate involved the
    piercing of the anterior portion of the central nervous system by the &#x0153;sophagus, while,
    at the same time, upward progress meant brain-development; brain-development meant concentration
    of nervous matter at the anterior end of the animal, with the result that in the highest
    scorpion and spider-like animals the brain-mass has so grown round and compressed the food-tube
    that nothing but fluid pabulum can pass through into the stomach; the whole group have become
    blood-suckers. These kinds of animals&mdash;the sea-scorpions&mdash;were the dominant race when
    the vertebrates first appeared: here in the natural competition among members of the dominant
    race the difficulty must have become acute. Further upward evolution demanded a larger and
    larger brain with the ensuing consequence of a greater and greater difficulty of food-supply.
    Nature's mistake was rectified and further evolution secured, not by degeneration in the
    brain-region, for that means degradation not upward progress, but by the formation of a new
    food-channel, in consequence of which the brain was free to develop to its fullest extent. Thus
    the great and mighty kingdom of the Vertebrata was evolved with its culminating
    organism&mdash;man&mdash;whose massive brain with all its possibilities could never have been
    evolved if he had still been <span class="pagenum" id="page67">{67}</span>compelled to pass the
    whole of his food through the narrow &#x0153;sophageal tube, still existent in him as the
    infundibular tube. This, then, is the working hypothesis upon which this book is written. If
    this view is right, that the Vertebrate was formed from the Pal√¶ostracan without any reversal of
    surfaces, but by the amalgamation of the central nervous system and alimentary canal, then it
    follows that we have various fixed points of comparison in the central nervous systems of the
    two groups of animals from which to search for further clues. It further follows that from such
    starting-point every organ of importance in the body of the arthropod ought to be visible in the
    corresponding position in the vertebrate, either as a functional or rudimentary organ. The
    subsequent chapters will deal with this detailed comparison of organs in the arthropod and
    vertebrate respectively.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Different Kinds of Eye.</span></p>

  <p>In all animals the eyes are composed of two parts. 1. A set of special sensory cells called the
  retina. 2. A dioptric apparatus for the purpose of forming an image on the sensory cells. The
  simplest eye is formed from a modified patch of the surface-epithelium; certain of the hypodermal
  cells, as they are called, elongate, and their cuticular surface becomes bulged to form a simple
  lens. These elongated cells form the retinal cells, and are connected with the central nervous
  system by nerve-fibres which constitute an optic nerve; the cells themselves may contain
  pigment.</p>

  <p>The more complicated eyes are modifications of this type for the purpose of making both the
  retina and the dioptric apparatus more perfect. According to a very prevalent view, these
  modifications have been brought about by invaginations of the surface-epithelium. Thus if ABCD
  (Fig. <a href="#fig28">28</a>) represents a portion of the surface-epithelium, the chitinous
  cuticle being represented by the dark line, with the hypodermal cells beneath, and if the part C
  is modified to form an optic sense-plate, then an invagination occurring between A and B will
  throw the retinal sense-cells with the optic nerve further from the surface, and the layers B and
  A between the retina and the source of light will be available for the formation of the dioptric
  apparatus. The lens is now formed from the cuticular surface of A, and the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page69">{69}</span>hypodermal cells of A elongate to form the layer known by the name of
  corneagen, or vitreogen, the cells of B remaining small and forming the pre-retinal layer of
  cells. The large optic nerve end-cells of the retinal layer, C, take up the position shown in the
  figure, and their cuticular surface becomes modified to form rods of varying shape called
  rhabdites, which are attached to the retinal cells. Frequently the rhabdites of neighbouring cells
  form definite groups, each group being called a rhabdome. Whatever shape they take it is
  invariably found that these little rods (bacilli), or rhabdites, are modifications of the
  cuticular surface of the cells which form the retinal layer. Also, as must necessarily be the case
  from the method of formation, the optic nerve arises from the nuclear end of the retinal cells,
  never from the bacillary end. As in the case first mentioned, so in this case, the light strikes
  direct upon the bacillary end of the retinal cells; such eyes, therefore, are eyes with an
  <i>upright retina</i>.</p>

  <div class="ac w45 fcenter sp3">
    <a href="images/fig028.png" id="fig28"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig028.png" alt=""

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 28.&mdash;Diagram of Formation of an Upright Simple
      Retina.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It may happen that the part invaginated is the optic sense-plate itself, as would be the case
  if in the former figure, instead of C, the part B was modified to form a sense-plate. This will
  give rise to an eye of a character different from the former (Fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a>). The
  optic nerve-fibres now lie between the source of light and the retinal end-cells, the layer A as
  before forms the cuticular lens, and its hypodermal cells elongate to form the corneagen; there is
  no pre-retinal layer, but, on the contrary, a post-retinal layer, C, called the tapetum, and, as
  is seen, the light passes through the retinal layer to the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page70">{70}</span>tapetum. The cuticular surface of the retinal cells forming the rods or
  bacilli is directed towards the tapetal layer away from the source of light, and the nuclei of the
  retinal cells are pre-bacillary in position, in contradistinction to the upright eye, where they
  are post-bacillary. The retinal end-cells are devoid of pigment, the pigment being in the tapetal
  layer.</p>

  <p>Such an eye, in contradistinction to the former type, is an eye with an <i>inverted retina</i>;
  but still the same law holds as in the former case&mdash;the optic nerve-fibres enter at the
  nuclear ends of the cells, and the rods are formed from the cuticular surface.</p>

  <p>In these eyes the pigmented tapetal layer is believed to act as a looking-glass; the dioptric
  apparatus throws the image on to its shiny surface, from whence it is reflected directly on to the
  rods, which are in close contact with the tapetum. A similar process has been suggested in the
  case of the mammalian lateral eye, with its inverted retina. Johnson describes the post-retinal
  pigmented layer as being frequently coloured and shiny, and imagines that it reflects the image
  directly back on to the rods.</p>

  <div class="ac w50 fcenter sp2">

      Retina.</span></p>
      <p class="sp0">The arrow shows the direction of the source of light in this as in the
      preceding figure. In both figures the cuticular rhabdites are represented by thick black
      lines.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Thus we see that eyes can be placed in different categories, <i>e.g.</i> those with an upright
  retina and those with an inverted retina; also, according to the presence or absence of a tapetum,
  eyes have been grouped as tapetal or non-tapetal. All the eyes considered so far are called simple
  eyes, or ocelli; and a number of ocelli may be <span class="pagenum"
  id="page71">{71}</span>contiguous though separate, as in the lateral eyes of the scorpion. They
  may, however, come into close contact and form one single, large, compound eye. Such ocelli, in a
  very large number of cases, retain each its own dioptric apparatus, and therefore the external
  appearance of the compound eye represents not a single lens, but a large number of facets, as is
  seen in the eyes of insects. Owing to these differences, eyes have been divided into simple and
  compound, and into facetted and non-facetted.</p>

  <p>Yet another complication occurs in the formation of eyes, which is, perhaps, the most important
  of all: the retinal portion of the eye, instead of consisting of simple retinal cells, with their
  accompanying rhabdites, may include within itself a portion of the central nervous system.</p>

  <p>The rationale of such a formation is as follows: The external covering of the body is formed by
  a layer of external epithelial cells&mdash;the ectodermal cell-layer&mdash;and an underlying
  neural layer, of which the latter gives origin to the central nervous system. As development
  proceeds, this central nervous system sinks inwards, leaving as its connection with the ectoderm
  the sensory nerves of the skin. That part of the neural layer which underlies the optic plate
  forms the optic ganglion, and when the central nervous system leaves the surface to take up its
  deeper position, the strand of nerve-fibres known as the optic nerve, is left connecting it with
  the retinal cells as seen in Figs. 28, 29. It may, however, happen that part of the optic ganglion
  remains at the surface, in close connection with the retinal end-cells, when the rest of the
  central nervous system sinks inwards. The retina of such an eye is composed of the combined optic
  ganglion and retinal end-cells; the strand of nerve-fibres which is left as the connection between
  it and the rest of the brain, which is also called the optic nerve, is not a true peripheral
  nerve, as in the first case, but rather a tract of fibres connecting two parts of the brain, of
  which one has remained at the periphery. Such a retina, in contradistinction to the first kind,
  may be called a <i>compound retina</i>.</p>

  <p>The optic ganglion, as seen in eyes with a simple retina, consists of a cortical layer of
  small, round nerve-cells, and an internal medulla of fine nerve-fibres, which form a thick network
  known as 'Punctsubstanz,' or in modern terminology, 'Neuropil.' Fibres which pass into this
  'neuropil' from other parts of the brain connect them with the optic ganglion.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page72">{72}</span></div>

  <p>At the present time, owing to the researches of Golgi, Ram√≥n y Cajal, and others, the nervous
  system is considered to be composed of a number of separate nerve-units, called neurones, each
  neurone consisting of a nerve-cell with its various processes; one of these&mdash;the
  neuraxon&mdash;constitutes the nerve-fibre belonging to that nerve-cell, the other
  processes&mdash;the dendrites&mdash;establish communication with other neurones. The place where
  these processes come together is called a synapse, and the tangle of fine fibres formed at a
  number of synapses forms the 'neuropil.'</p>

  <p>When, therefore, a compound retina is formed by the amalgamation of the ectodermal
  part&mdash;the retinal cells proper&mdash;with the neurodermic part&mdash;to which the name
  'retinal ganglion' may be given,&mdash;such a retina consists of neuropil substance and
  nerve-cells, as well as the retinal end-cells. In all such compound retinas, the retinal ganglion
  is not single, but two optic ganglia at least are included in it, so that there are two sets of
  nerve-cells and two synapses are always formed; one between the retinal end-cells and the neurones
  of the first optic ganglion, which may be called the ganglion of the retina, the other between the
  first and second ganglia, which, seeing that the neuraxons of its cells form the optic nerve, may
  be called the ganglion of the optic nerve. The 'neuropil' formed by these synapses forms the
  molecular layers of the compound retina, and the cells themselves form the nuclear layers. Thus an
  upright compound retina, formed in the same way as the upright simple retina, would be illustrated
  by Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page73">{73}</span></div>

  <p>Further, in precisely the same way as in the case of the simple retina, such a compound retina
  may be upright or inverted. Thus, in the lateral eyes of crustaceans and insects, a compound
  retina of this kind is formed, which is upright; while in the vertebrates the compound retina of
  the lateral eyes is inverted.</p>

  <p>The compound retina of vertebrates is usually described as composed of a series of layers,
  which may be analyzed into their several components as follows<span

  <p>The difference between the development of these two types of eye&mdash;those with a simple
  retina and those with a compound retina&mdash;has led, in the most natural manner, to the
  conception that the retina is developed, in the higher animals, sometimes from the cells of the
  peripheral epidermis, sometimes from the tissue of the brain&mdash;two modes of development termed
  by Balfour 'peripheral' and 'cerebral.' An historical survey of the question shows most
  conclusively that all investigators are agreed in ascribing the origin of the simple retina to the
  peripheral method of development, the retina being formed from the hypodermal cells by a process
  of invagination, while the cerebral type of development has been described only in the development
  of the compound retina. The natural conclusion from this fact is that, in watching the development
  of the compound retina, it is more difficult to differentiate the layers formed from the epidermal
  retinal cells and those formed from the epidermal optic ganglion-cells, than in the case of the
  simple retina, where the latter cells withdraw entirely from the surface. This is the conclusion
  to which Patten has come, and, indeed, judging from the text-book of Korschelt and Heider, it is
  the generally received opinion of the day that, as far as the Appendiculata are concerned, the
  retina, in the true sense&mdash;the retinal end-cells, with their cuticular rods,&mdash;is formed,
  in all cases, from the peripheral cells of the hypodermal layer, the cuticular rods being
  modifications of the general cuticular surface of the body. The apparent cerebral development of
  the crustacean <span class="pagenum" id="page74">{74}</span>retina, as quoted from Bobretsky by
  Balfour, is therefore in reality the development of the retinal ganglion, and not of the retina
  proper.</p>

  <p class="sp3">There is, I imagine, a universal belief that the natural mode of origin of a
  sense-organ, such as the eye, must always have been from the cells forming the external surface of
  the animal, and that direct origin from the central nervous system is <i>a priori</i> most
  improbable. It is, therefore, a matter of satisfaction to find that the evidence for the latter
  origin has universally broken down, with the single exception of the eyes of vertebrates and their
  degenerated allies; a fact which points strongly to the probability that a reconsideration of the
  evidence upon which the present teaching of the origin of the vertebrate eye is based will show
  that here, too, a confusion has arisen between that part formed from the epidermal surface and
  that from the optic ganglion.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Median or Pineal Eyes.</span></p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, in recent times, the most important clue to the ancestry of vertebrates has been
  given by the discovery that the so-called pineal gland in the vertebrate brain is all that remains
  of a pair of median or pineal eyes, the existence of which is manifest in the earliest
  vertebrates; so that the vertebrate, when it first arose, possessed a pair of median eyes as well
  as a pair of lateral eyes. The ancestor of the vertebrate, therefore, must also have possessed a
  pair of median eyes as well as a pair of lateral eyes.</p>

  <p>Very instructive, indeed, is the evidence with regard to these median eyes, for one of the
  great characteristics of the ancient pal√¶ostracan forms is the invariable presence of a pair of
  median eyes as well as a pair of lateral eyes. In the living representative of such
  forms&mdash;Limulus&mdash;the pair of median eyes (Fig. <a href="#fig5">5</a>) is well shown, and
  it is significant that here, according to Lankester and Bourne, these eyes are already in a
  condition of degeneration; so also in many of the Pal√¶ostraca (Fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>) the
  lateral eyes are the large, well-developed eyes, while the median eyes resemble those of Limulus
  in their insignificance.</p>

  <p>We see, then, that in the dominant arthropod race at the time when the fishes first appeared,
  the type of eyes consisted of a pair of well-developed lateral eyes and a pair of insignificant,
  partially degenerated, median eyes. Further, according to all pal√¶ontologists, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page75">{75}</span>in the best-preserved head-shields of the most ancient
  fishes, especially well seen in the Osteostraci, in Cephalaspis, Tremataspis, Auchenaspis,
  Keraspis, a pair of large, prominent lateral eyes existed, between which, in the mid-line, are
  seen a pair of small, insignificant median eyes.</p>

  <p>The evidence of the rocks, therefore, proves that the pair of median eyes which were originally
  the principal eyes (Hauptaugen), had already, in the dominant arthropod group been supplanted by a
  pair of lateral eyes, and had, in consequence, become small and insignificant, at the time when
  vertebrates first appeared. This dwindling process thus initiated in the arthropod itself has
  steadily continued ever since through the whole development of the vertebrates, with the result
  that, in the highest vertebrates, these median or pineal eyes have become converted into the
  pineal gland with its 'brain-sand.'</p>

  <p>In the earliest vertebrate these median eyes may have been functional; they certainly were more
  conspicuous than in later forms. Alone among living vertebrates the right median eye of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes is so perfect and the skin covering it so transparent that I have always felt
  doubtful whether it may not be of use to the animal, especially when one takes into consideration
  the undeveloped state of the lateral eyes in this animal, hidden as they are under the skin. Thus
  the one living vertebrate which is comparable with these extinct fishes is the one in which one of
  the pineal eyes is most well defined, most nearly functional.</p>

  <p>Before passing to the consideration of the structure of the median eyes of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, it
  is advisable to see whether these median eyes in other animals, such as arachnids and crustaceans,
  belong to any particular type of eyes, for then assuredly the median eyes of Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  ought to belong to the same type if they are derived from them.</p>

  <p>In the specialized crustacean, as in the specialized vertebrate, the median eyes have
  disappeared, at all events in the adult, but still exist in the primitive forms, such as
  Branchipus, which resemble the trilobites in some respects. On the other hand, the median eyes
  have persisted, and are well developed in the arachnids, both scorpions and spiders possessing a
  well-developed pair. The characteristics of the median eyes must then be especially sought for in
  the arachnid group.</p>

  <p>Both scorpions and spiders possess many eyes, of which two are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page76">{76}</span>always separate and median in position, while the others form lateral
  groups; all these eyes possess a simple retina and a simple corneal lens. Grenacher was the first
  to point out that in the spiders two very distinct types of eye are found. In the one the retina
  is upright; in the other the retina is inverted, and the eye possesses a tapetal layer. The
  distribution of these two types is most suggestive, for the inverted retina is always found in the
  lateral eyes, never in the two median eyes; these always possess a simple upright retina.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the crustaceans, the lateral eyes differ also from the median eyes, but not in
  the same way as in the arachnids; for here both types of eye possess an upright retina, but the
  retina of the lateral eyes is compound, while that of the median eyes is simple. In other words,
  the median eyes are in all cases eyes with a simple upright retina and a simple cuticular lens,
  while the retina of the lateral eyes is compound or may be inverted, according as the animal in
  question possesses crustacean or arachnid affinities. The lateral eye of the vertebrate,
  possessing, as it does, an inverted compound retina, indicates that the vertebrate arose from a
  stock which was neither arachnid nor crustacean, but gave rise to both groups&mdash;in fact, was a
  member of the great pal√¶ostracan group. What, then, is the nature of the median eyes in the
  vertebrate?</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Median Eyes of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>The evidence of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is so conclusive that I, for one, cannot conceive how it is
  possible for any zoologist to doubt whether the parietal organ, as they insist on calling it, had
  ever been an eye, or rather a pair of eyes.</p>

  <p>Anyone who examines the head of the larval lamprey will see on the dorsal side, in the median
  line, first, a somewhat circular orifice&mdash;the unpaired nasal opening; and then, tailwards to
  this, a well-marked circular spot, where the skin is distinctly more transparent than elsewhere.
  This spot coincides in position with the underlying dorsal pineal eye, which shines out
  conspicuously owing to the glistening whiteness of its pigment. Upon opening the brain-case the
  appearance as in Fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a> is seen, and the mass of the right <i>ganglion
  habenul√¶</i> (<i>G.H.R.</i>), as it has been called, stands out conspicuously as well as the right
  or dorsal pineal eye (<i>Pn.</i>). Both eye and ganglion appear at first sight to be one-sided,
  but further examination shows that a left <i>ganglion habenul√¶</i> is present, though much smaller
  than on <span class="pagenum" id="page77">{77}</span>the right side. In connection with this is
  another eye-like organ&mdash;the left or ventral pineal eye,&mdash;much more aborted, much less
  like an eye than the dorsal one; so also there are two bundles of peculiar fibres called Meynert's
  bundles, which connect this region with the infra-infundibular region of the brain; of these, the
  right Meynert's bundle is much larger than the left.</p>

  <p>This difference between right and left indicates a greater degeneration on the left side, and
  points distinctly to a close relationship between the nerve-masses known as <i>ganglia
  habenul√¶</i> and the median eyes. In my opinion this ganglion is, in part, at all events, the
  optic ganglion of the median eye on each side. It is built up on the same type as the optic
  ganglia of invertebrate simple eyes, with a cortex of small round cells and a medulla of fine
  nerve-fibres. Into this ganglion, on the right side, there passes a very well-defined
  nerve&mdash;the nerve of the dorsal eye. The eye itself with its nerve, <i>pn.</i>, and its optic
  ganglion, <i>g.h.r.</i>, is beautifully shown by means of a horizontal section through the head of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes (Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>). Originally, as described by Scott, the eye stood
  vertically <span class="pagenum" id="page79">{79}</span>above its optic ganglion, and presented an
  appearance remarkably like Fig. <a href="#fig32">32</a>, which represents one of the simple eyes
  and optic ganglia of a larva of Acilius as described by Patten; then, with the forward growth of
  the upper lip, the right pineal eye was dragged forward and its nerve pulled horizontally over the
  <i>ganglion habenul√¶</i>. For this reason the eye, nerve, and ganglion are better shown in a
  nearly horizontal than in a transverse section.</p>

  <p>The optic nerve belonging to this eye is most evident and clearly shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig31">31</a>, and in the series of consecutive sections which follow upon this section; no
  doubt can arise as to the structure in question having been the nerve of the eye, even though, as
  is possible, it does not contain any functional nerve-fibres.</p>

  <p>The second, ventral or left, eye, belonging to the left ganglion habenul√¶ is very different in
  appearance, being much less evidently an eye. Fig. <a href="#fig34">34</a> is one of the same
  series of horizontal sections as Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>, <i>pn.<sub>1</sub></i> being the
  last remnant of the right, or dorsal, eye, while <i>pn.<sub>2</sub></i> shows the left, or
  ventral, eye with its connection with the left <i>ganglion habenul√¶</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page80">{80}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">In a series of sections I have followed the nerve of the right pineal eye to its
  destination, as described in my paper in the <i>Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science</i>,
  and have found that it enters into the <i>ganglion habenul√¶</i> just as the nerve to any simple
  eye enters into its optic ganglion. This nerve, as I have shown, is a very distinct, well-defined
  nerve, with no admixture of ganglion-cells or of connective tissue, very different indeed to the
  connection between the left pineal eye and its optic ganglion. Here there is no defined nerve at
  all; but the cells of the <i>ganglion habenul√¶</i> stretch right up to the remains of the eye
  itself. Seeing, then, that both the eye and ganglion on this side have reached a much further
  grade of degeneration than on the right side, it may be fairly concluded that the original
  condition of these two median eyes is more nearly represented by the right eye, with its
  well-defined nerve and optic ganglion, than by the left eye, or by the eyes in lizards and other
  animals which do not show so well-defined a nerve as is possessed by Ammoc&#x0153;tes. Quite
  recently Dendy has examined the two median eyes in the New Zealand lamprey <i>Geotria
  australis</i>. In this species the second eye is much better defined than in the European lamprey,
  and its connection with the <i>ganglion habenul√¶</i> is more nerve-like. In neither eye, however,
  is the nerve so clean cut and isolated as is the nerve of the dorsal, or right, eye in the
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes stage of <i>Petromyzon Planeri</i>; in both, cells resembling those of the cortex
  of the <i>ganglion habenul√¶</i> and connective tissues are mixed up with the nerve-fibres which
  pass from each eye to its respective optic ganglion.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Right Pineal Eye of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>The optic fibres of the right median eye of Ammoc&#x0153;tes are connected with a well-defined
  retina, the limits of which are defined by the white pigment so characteristic of this eye. This
  pigment is apparently calcium phosphate, which still remains as the 'brain-sand' of the human
  pineal gland. The cells, which are hidden by this pigment, were described by me in 1890 as the
  retinal end-cells with large nuclei. In 1893, Studni√ßka examined them more closely, and concluded
  that the retinal cells are of two kinds: the one, nerve end-cells, the sensory cells proper; the
  other, pigmented epithelial cells, which surround the sense-cells. The sense-cells may contain
  some of the white pigment, but not so much as the other cells. Similarly, in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page81">{81}</span>median eyes of Limulus, Lankester and Bourne find it
  difficult to determine how far the retinal end-cells contain pigment and how far that pigment
  really is in the cells surrounding these nerve end-cells.</p>

  <p>The interior of the eye presents the appearance of a cavity in shape like a cornucopia, the
  stalk of which terminates at the place where the nerve enters. This cavity is not empty, but the
  posterior part of it is filled with the termination of the nerve end-cells of the retina, as
  pointed out by me and confirmed by Studni√ßka. These terminations are free from pigment, and
  contain strikingly translucent bodies, which I have described in my paper in the <i>Quarterly
  Journal</i>, and called rhabdites, for they present the same appearance and are situated in the
  same position as are many of the rhabdites on the terminations of the retinal end-cells of
  arthropod eyes. Studni√ßka has also seen these appearances, and figures them in his second paper on
  the nerve end-cells of the pineal eye of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>Up to this point the following conclusions may be drawn<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p>1.  Ammoc&#x0153;tes possesses a pair of median eyes, just as was the case with the most
    ancient fishes, and with the members of the contemporary pal√¶ostracan group.</p>
    <p>2.  The retina of one of these eyes is well-defined and upright, not inverted, and therefore
    in this respect agrees with that of all median eyes.</p>
    <p>3.  The presence of nerve end-cells, with pigment either in them or in cells around them, to
    the unpigmented ends of which translucent bodies resembling rhabdites are attached, is another
    proof that this retina agrees with that of the median eyes of arthropods.</p>
    <p class="sp0">4.  The simple nature of the nerve with its termination in an optic ganglion
    closely resembling in structure an arthropod optic ganglion, together with Studni√ßka's statement
    that the nerve end-cells pass directly into the nerve, points directly to the conclusion that
    this retina is a simple, not a compound, retina, and that it therefore in this respect also
    agrees with the retina of all median eyes.</p>
  </div>

  <p>With respect to this last conclusion, neither I myself nor Studni√ßka have been able to see any
  definite groups of cells between the nerve end-cells and the optic nerve such as a compound retina
  necessitates.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page82">{82}</span></div>

  <p>On the other hand, Dendy describes in the New Zealand lamprey, <i>Geotria australis</i>, a
  cavity where the nerve enters into the eye, which he calls the atrium. This cavity is distinct
  from the main cavity of the eye, and is separated from it by a mass of cells similar in appearance
  to those of the cortex of the <i>ganglion habenul√¶</i>. In these two eyes then, groups of cells,
  resembling in appearance those belonging to an optic ganglion, exist in the eyes themselves. This
  atrium is evidently that part of the central cavity which I have called the handle of the
  cornucopia in the European lamprey, and the very fact that it is separated from the rest of the
  central cavity is evidence that we are dealing here with a later stage in the history of the
  pineal eyes than in the case of the Ammoc&#x0153;tes of <i>Petromyzon Planeri</i>. Taking also
  into consideration the continuity of the mass of small ganglion-cells which surround this atrium
  with the cells of the <i>ganglion habenul√¶</i> by means of the similar cells scattered along the
  course of the nerve, and also bearing in mind the fact already stated that in the more degenerate
  left eye of Ammoc&#x0153;tes the cells of the <i>ganglion habenul√¶</i> extend right up to the eye
  itself, it seems more likely than not that these cells do not represent the original optic
  ganglion of a compound retina, but rather the subsequent invasion, by way of the pineal nerve, of
  ganglion-cells belonging to a portion of the brain. In the last chapter it has been suggested that
  the presence of the trochlear or fourth cranial nerve has given rise to the formation of the
  cerebellum by a similar spreading.</p>

  <p>There is certainly no appearance in the least resembling a compound retina such as is seen in
  the vertebrate or crustacean lateral eye. In the median eyes of scorpions and of Limulus, cells
  are found within the capsule of the eye among the nerve-fibres and the nerve end-cells. These are
  especially numerous in the median eyes of Limulus, as described by Lankester and Bourne, and are
  called by them intrusive connective tissue cells. The meaning of these cells is not, to my mind,
  yet settled. It is sufficient for my purpose to point out that the presence of cells interneural
  in position among the nerve end-cells of the retina of the median eyes of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is more
  probable than not, on the assumption that the retina of these eyes is built up on the same plan as
  that of the median eyes in Limulus and the scorpions.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is further to be borne in mind that these specimens of <i>Geotria</i> worked at
  by Dendy were in the 'Velasia' stage of the New Zealand <span class="pagenum"
  id="page83">{83}</span>lamprey, and correspond, therefore, more nearly to the Petromyzon than to
  the Ammoc&#x0153;tes stage of the European lamprey.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Dioptric Apparatus.</span></p>

  <p>Besides the retina, all eyes possess a dioptric apparatus. What is the evidence as to its
  nature in these vertebrate median eyes? Lankester and Bourne have divided the eyes of scorpions
  and Limulus into two kinds, monostichous and diplostichous. In the first the retinal cells are
  supposed to give rise to not only rhabdites but also the cuticular chitinous lens, so that the eye
  is one-layered; in the second the lens is formed by a well-marked hypodermal layer, in front of
  the retina, composed of elongated cells, so that these eyes are two-layered or diplostichous. The
  lateral eyes, according to them, are all monostichous, but the median eyes are diplostichous.</p>

  <div class="ac w40 fcenter sp2">

  <p>This distinction is not considered valid by other observers. Thus, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page84">{84}</span>as already indicated, Patten looks on all these eyes as three-layered, and
  states that in all cases a corneagen or vitreogen layer exists, which gives origin to the lens.
  For my own part I agree with Patten, but we are not concerned here with the lateral eyes. It is
  sufficient to note that all observers are agreed that the median eyes are characterized by this
  well-marked cell-layer, the so-called vitreous or corneagen layer of cells.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This layer (<i>c.</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig35">35</a>) is composed of much-elongated cells of the
  hypodermal layer, in each of which the large nucleus is always situated towards the base of the
  cell. The space between it and the retina contains, according to Patten the cells of the
  pre-retinal layer <i>(pr.)</i>. These may be so few and insignificant as to give the impression
  that the vitreous layer is immediately adjacent to the retina (<i>ret.</i>).</p>

  <p>Let us turn now to the right pineal eye of Ammoc&#x0153;tes (Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>) and
  see what its further structure is. The anterior part of the eye is free from pigment, and is
  composed, as is seen in h√¶matoxylin or carmine specimens, of an inner layer of nuclei which are
  frequently arranged in a wavy line. From this nucleated layer, strands of tissue, free from
  nuclei, pass to the anterior edge of the eye.</p>

  <p>In the horizontal longitudinal sections it is seen that these strands are confined to the
  middle of the eye. On each side of them the nuclear layer reaches the periphery, so that if we
  consider these strands to represent long cylindrical cells, as described by Beard, then the
  anterior wall may be described as consisting of long cylindrical cells, which are flanked on
  either side by shorter cells of a similar kind. The nuclei at the base of these cylindrical cells
  are not all alike. We see, in the first place, large nuclei resembling the large nuclei belonging
  to the nerve end-cells; these are the nuclei of <span class="pagenum" id="page85">{85}</span>the
  long cylindrical cells. We see also smaller nuclei in among these larger ones, which look like
  nuclei of intrusive connective tissue, or may perhaps form a distinct layer of cells, situated
  between the cells of the anterior wall and the terminations of the nerve end-cells already
  referred to.</p>

  <p>These elongated cells are in exactly the same position and present the same appearance as the
  cells of the corneagen layer of any median eye. Like the latter they are free from pigment and
  never show with osmic staining any sign of the presence of translucent rhabdite-like bodies, such
  as are seen in the termination of the retinal cells, and like the latter their nuclei are at the
  base. The resemblance between this layer and the corneagen cells of any median eye is absolute.
  Between it and the terminations of the retinal cells there exists some ill-defined material
  certainly containing cells which may well correspond to Patten's pre-retinal layer of cells.</p>

  <p>Retina, corneagen, nerve, optic ganglion, all are there, all in their right position, all of
  the right structure, what more is needed to complete the picture?</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In order to complete the dioptric apparatus a lens is necessary. Where, then, is the lens in
  these pineal eyes? In all the arachnid eyes, whether median or lateral, the lens is a single
  corneal lens composed of the external cuticle, which is thickened over the corneagen cells. This
  thickened cuticle is composed of chitin, and is not cellular, but is dead material formed out of
  the living underlying corneagen cells. Such a lens is in marked contrast to the lens of the
  lateral vertebrate eye, which is formed by living cells themselves. This <span class="pagenum"
  id="page86">{86}</span>thickening of the cuticular layer to form a lens could only exist as long
  as that layer is absolutely external, so that the light strikes immediately upon it; for, if from
  any cause the eye became situated internally, the place of such a lens must be filled by the
  structures situated between it and the surface, and the thickened cuticle would no longer be
  formed.</p>

  <p>In all vertebrates these pineal eyes are separated from the external surface by a greater or
  less thickness of tissues; in the case of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, as is seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig31">31</a>, the eye lies within the membranous cranial wall, and is attached closely to
  it. The position, then, of the cuticular, or corneal lens, as it is often called, on the
  supposition that this is a median eye of the arachnid type, is taken by the membranous cranium,
  and, as I have described in my paper in the <i>Quarterly Journal</i>, on carefully lifting the eye
  in the fresh condition from the cranial wall, it can be seen under a dissecting microscope that
  the cranial wall often forms at this spot a lens-like bulging, which fits the shallow concavity of
  the surface of the eye, and requires some little force to separate it from the eye.</p>

  <p>As will appear in a subsequent chapter, this cranial wall has been formed by the growth,
  laterally and dorsally, of a skeletal structure known by the name of the <i>plastron</i>. The last
  part of it to be completed would be that part in the mid-dorsal line, where apparently, in
  consequence of the insinking of the degenerating eyes, a dermal and subdermal layer already
  intervened between the source of light and the eyes themselves.</p>

  <p>When the membranous cranium was completed in the mid-dorsal region, it was situated here as
  elsewhere just internally to the subdermal layer, and therefore enclosed the pineal eyes. This, to
  my mind, is the reason why the pineal eyes, which, in all other respects, conform to the type of
  the median eyes of an arachnid-like animal, do not possess a cuticular lens. Other observers have
  attempted to make a lens out of the elongated cells of the anterior wall of the eye (my corneagen
  layer), but without success.</p>

  <p>Studni√ßka, who calls this layer the <i>pellucida</i>, does not look upon it as the lens, but
  considers, strangely enough, that the translucent appearances at the ends of each nerve end-cell
  represent a lens for that cell, so that every nerve end-cell has its own lens. Still more strange
  is it that, holding this view, he should yet consider these knobs <span class="pagenum"
  id="page87">{87}</span>to be joined by filaments to the cells in the anterior wall of the eye, a
  conception fatal to the action of such knobs as lenses.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The discovery that the vertebrate possesses, in addition to the lateral eyes, a
  pair of median eyes, which are most conspicuous in the lowest living vertebrate, together with the
  fact that such eyes are built up on the same plan as the median eyes of living crustaceans or
  arachnids, not only with respect to the eye itself but also to its nerve and optic ganglion,
  constitutes a fact of the very greatest importance for any theory of the origin of vertebrates;
  especially in view of the further fact, that similar eyes in the same position are found not only
  in all the members of the Pal√¶ostraca, but also in all those ancient forms (classed as fishes)
  which lived at that time. At one and the same moment it proves the utter impossibility of
  reversing dorsal and ventral surfaces, points in the very strongest manner to the origin of the
  vertebrate from some member or other of the pal√¶ostracan group, and insists that the advocates of
  the origin of vertebrates from the Hemichordata, etc., should give an explanation of the presence
  of these two median eyes of a more convincing character than that given here.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Lateral Eyes.</span></p>

  <p>Turning now to the consideration of the lateral eyes, we see that these eyes in the arachnids
  often possess an inverted retina, in the crustaceans always an upright retina. In the arachnids
  they possess a simple retina, while in the crustaceans their retina is compound; so that in the
  latter case the so-called optic nerve is in reality a tract of fibres connecting together the
  brain-region with a variable number of optic ganglia, which have been left at the periphery in
  close contact with the retinal cells, when the brain sunk away from the superficial epithelial
  covering.</p>

  <p>There is, then, this difference between the lateral eyes of crustaceans and arachnids, that the
  retina of the former is compound, but never inverted, while that of the latter may be inverted,
  but is always simple.</p>

  <p>The retina of the lateral eyes of the vertebrate resembles both of these, for it is compound,
  as in the crustacean, and inverted as in the arachnid.</p>

  <p>It must always be borne in mind that in the pal√¶ostracan epoch <span class="pagenum"
  id="page88">{88}</span>the dominant race was neither crustacean nor arachnid, but partook of the
  characters of both; also, as is characteristic of dominance, there was very great variety of form,
  so that it seems more probable than not that some of these forms may have combined the arachnid
  and crustacean characteristics to the extent of possessing lateral eyes with an inverted yet
  compound retina. A certain amount of evidence points in this direction. As already stated, the
  compound retina which characterizes the vertebrate lateral eyes is characteristic of all facetted
  eyes, and in the trilobites facetted lateral eyes are commonly found. From this it may be
  concluded that many of the trilobites possessed eyes with a compound retina. There have, however,
  been found in certain species, e.g. <i>Harpes vittatus</i> and <i>Harpes ungula</i>, lateral eyes
  which were not facetted, and are believed by Korschelt and Heider to be of an arachnid nature.
  They say, "Pal√¶ontologists have appropriately described them as ocelli, although, from a
  zoological point of view, they do not deserve this name, having most probably arisen in a way
  similar to that conjectured in connection with the lateral eyes of scorpions." If this conjecture
  is right, then in these forms the retina may have been inverted, but because they belonged to the
  trilobite group, the retina was most probably compound, so that here we may have had the
  combination of the arachnid and crustacean characteristics. On the other hand, in some forms of
  Branchipus, and many of the Gammarid√¶, a single corneal lens is found in conjunction with an eye
  of the crustacean type, so that a non-facetted lateral eye, found in a fossil form, would not
  necessarily imply the arachnid type of eye with the possibility of an inverted retina. Whatever
  may be the ultimate decision upon these particular forms, the striking fact remains, that both in
  the vertebrate and in the arachnid the median eyes possess a simple upright retina, while the
  lateral eyes possess an inverted retina, and that both in the vertebrate and the crustacean the
  median eyes possess a simple upright retina, while the lateral eyes possess a compound retina.</p>

  <p>The resemblance of the retina of the lateral eyes of vertebrates to that of the lateral eyes of
  many arthropods, especially crustaceans, has been pointed out by nearly every one who has worked
  at these invertebrate lateral eyes. The foundation of our knowledge of the compound retina is
  Berger's well-known paper, the results of which are summed up by him in the following two main
  conclusions.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page89">{89}</span></div>

  <p>1.  The optic ganglion of the Arthropoda consists of two parts, of which the one stands in
  direct inseparable connection with the facetted eye, and together with the layer of retinal rods
  forms the retina of the facetted eye, while the other part is connected rather with the brain, and
  is to be considered as an integral part of the brain in the narrower sense of the word.</p>

      (indicated only).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>2.  In all arthropods examined by him, the retina consists of five layers, as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>(1)  The layer of rods and their nuclei.</p>
    <p>(2)  The layer of nerve-bundles.</p>
    <p>(3)  The nuclear layer.</p>
    <p>(4)  The molecular layer.</p>
    <p>(5)  The ganglion cell layer.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Berger passes under review the structure and arrangement of the optic ganglion in a large
  number of different groups of arthropods, and concludes that in all cases one part of the optic
  ganglion is always closely attached to the visual end-cells, and this combination he calls the
  retina. On the other hand, the nerve-fibres which connect the peripheral part of the optic
  ganglion with the brain, the so-called optic nerve, are by no means homologous in the different
  groups; for in some cases, as in many of the stalk-eyed crustaceans, the whole optic ganglion is
  at the periphery, while in others, as in the Diptera, only the retinal ganglion is at the
  periphery, and the nerve-stalk connects this with the rest of the optic ganglion, the latter being
  fused with the main brain-mass. In the Diptera, in fact, according to Berger, the optic nerve
  <span class="pagenum" id="page90">{90}</span>and retina are most nearly comparable to those of the
  vertebrate. For this reason I give Berger's picture of the retina of Musca (Fig. <a
  href="#fig38">38</a>), in order to show the arrangement there of the retinal layers.</p>

  <div class="ac w35 fcenter sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In Branchipus and other primitive Crustacea, Berger also finds the same retinal layers, but is
  unable to distinguish in the brain the rest of the optic ganglion. Judging from Berger's
  description of Branchipus, and Bellonci's of Sph√¶roma, it would almost appear as though the
  cerebral part of the retina in the higher forms originated from two ganglionic enlargements, an
  external and internal enlargement, as Bellonci calls them. The external ganglion (<i>Op. g.
  I.</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig39">39</a>) may be called the ganglion of the retina, the cells of which
  form the nuclear layer of the higher forms, and the internal ganglion (<i>Op. g. II.</i>, Fig. <a
  href="#fig39">39</a>), from which the optic nerve-fibres to the brain arise, may therefore be
  called the ganglion of the optic nerve. Bellonci describes how in this latter ganglion cells are
  found very different to the small ones of the external ganglion or ganglion of the retina. So also
  in Branchipus, judging from the pictures of Berger, Claus, and from my own observations
  (<i>cf.</i> Fig. <a href="#fig46">46</a>, in which the double nature of the retinal ganglion is
  indicated), the peripheral part of the optic ganglion&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the retinal
  ganglion&mdash;may be spoken <span class="pagenum" id="page91">{91}</span>of as composed of two
  ganglia. The external of these is clearly the ganglion of the retina; its cells form the nuclear
  layer, the striking character of which, and close resemblance to the corresponding layer in
  vertebrates, is shown by Claus' picture, which I reproduce (Fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>). The
  internal ganglion with which the optic nerve is in connection contains large ganglion cells,
  which, together with smaller ones, form the ganglionic layer of Berger.</p>

  <p>The most recent observations of the structure of the compound retina of the crustacean eye are
  those of Parker, who, by the use of the methylene blue method, and Golgi's method of staining, has
  been able to follow out the structure of the compound retina in the arthropod on the same lines as
  had already been done for the vertebrate. These two methods have led to the conclusion that the
  arthropod central nervous system and the vertebrate central nervous system are built up in the
  same manner&mdash;viz. by means of a series of ganglia connected together, each ganglion being
  composed of nerve-cells, nerve-fibres, and a fine reticulated substance called by Leydig in
  arthropods 'Punktsubstanz,' and known in vertebrates and in invertebrates at the present time as
  'neuropil.' A further analysis resolves the whole system into a combination of groups of neurones,
  the cells and fibres of which form the cells and fibres of the ganglia, while their dendritic
  connections with the terminations of other neurones, together with the neuroglia-cells form the
  'neuropil.' As is natural to expect, that part of the central nervous system which helps to form
  the compound retina is built up in the same manner as the rest of the central nervous system.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Thus, according to Parker, the mass of nervous tissue which occupies the central part of the
  optic stalk in Astacus is composed <span class="pagenum" id="page92">{92}</span>of four distinct
  ganglia; the retina is connected with the first of these by means of the retinal fibres, and the
  optic nerve extends proximally from the fourth ganglion to the brain. Each ganglion consists of
  ganglion-cells, nerve-fibres, and 'neuropil,' and, in addition, supporting cells of a neuroglial
  type. By means of the methylene blue method and the Golgi method, it is seen that the retinal
  end-cells, with their visual rods, are connected with the fibres of the optic nerve by means of a
  system of neurones, the synapses of which take place in and help to form the 'neuropil' of the
  various ganglia. Thus, an impulse in passing from the retina to the brain would ordinarily travel
  over five neurones, beginning with one of the first order and ending with one of the fifth. He
  makes five neurones although there are only four ganglia, because he reckons the retinal cell with
  its elongated fibre as a neurone of the first order, such fibre terminating in dendritic processes
  which form synapses in the 'neuropil' of the first ganglion with the neurones of the second
  order.</p>

  <p>Similarly the neurones of the second order terminate in the 'neuropil' of the second ganglion,
  and so on, until we reach the neurones of the fifth order, which terminate on the one hand in the
  'neuropil' of the fourth ganglion, and on the other pass to the optic lobes of the brain by their
  long neuraxons&mdash;the fibres of the optic nerve.</p>

  <p>He compares this arrangement with that of Branchipus, Apus, Estheria, Daphnia, etc., and shows
  that in the more primitive crustaceans the peripheral optic apparatus was composed, not of four
  but of two optic ganglia, not, therefore, of five but of three neurones, viz.&mdash;</p>

  <p>1.  The neurone of the first order&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the retinal cell with its fibre
  terminating in the 'neuropil' of the first optic ganglion (ganglion of the retina).</p>

  <p>2.  The neurone of the second order, which terminates in the 'neuropil' of the second ganglion
  (ganglion of the optic nerve).</p>

  <p>3.  The neurone of the third order, which terminates in the optic lobes of the brain by means
  of its neuraxons (the optic nerve).</p>

  <p>We see, then, that the most recent researches agree with the older ones of Berger, Claus, and
  Bellonci, in picturing the retina of the primitive crustacean forms as formed of two ganglia only,
  and not of four, as in the specialized crustacean group the Malacostraca.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page93">{93}</span></div>

  <p>The comparison of the arthropod compound retina with that of the vertebrate shows, as one would
  expect upon the theory of the origin of vertebrates put forward in this book, that the latter
  retina is built up of two ganglia, as in the more primitive less specialized crustacean forms. The
  modern description of the vertebrate retina, based upon the Golgi method of staining, is exactly
  Parker's description of the simpler form of crustacean retina in which the 'neuropil' of the first
  ganglion is represented by the external molecular layer, and that of the second ganglion by the
  internal molecular layer; the three sets of neurones being, according to Parker's terminology<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1.  The neurones of the first order&mdash;viz. the visual cells&mdash;the nuclei of which form
  the external nuclear layer, and their long attenuated processes form synapses in the external
  molecular layer with</p>

  <p>2.  The neurones of the second order, the cells of which form the internal nuclear layer, and
  their processes form synapses in the internal molecular layer with</p>

  <p>3.  The neurones of the third order, the cells of which form the ganglionic layer and their
  neuraxons constitute the fibres of the optic nerve which end in the optic lobes of the brain.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Strictly speaking, of course, the visual cells with their elongated processes have
  no right to be called neurones: I only use Parker's phraseology in order to show how closely the
  two retinas agree even to the formation of synapses between the fine drawn-out processes of the
  visual cells and the neurones of the ganglion of the retina.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Retina of the Lateral Eye of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>As in the case of all other organs, it follows that if we are dealing here with a true genetic
  relationship, then the lower we go in the vertebrate kingdom the more nearly ought the structure
  of the retina to approach the arthropod type. It is therefore a matter of intense interest to
  determine the nature of the retina in Ammoc&#x0153;tes in order to see whether it differs from
  that of the higher vertebrates, and if so, whether such differences are explicable by reference to
  the structure of the arthropod eye.</p>

  <p>Before describing the structure of this retina it is necessary to clear away a remarkable
  misconception, shared among others by <span class="pagenum" id="page94">{94}</span>Balfour, that
  this eye is an aborted eye, and that it cannot be considered as a primitive type. Thus Balfour
  says: "Considering the degraded character of the Ammoc&#x0153;te eye, evidence derived from its
  structure must be received with caution," and later on, "the most interesting cases of partial
  degeneration are those of Myxine and the Ammoc&#x0153;te. The development of such aborted eyes has
  as yet been studied only in the Ammoc&#x0153;te, in which it resembles in most important features
  that of other Vertebrata."</p>

  <p>Again and again the aborted character of the eye is stated to be evidence of degeneration in
  the case of the lamprey. What such a statement means, why the eye is in any way to be considered
  as aborted, is to me a matter of absolute wonderment: it is true that in the larval form it lies
  under the skin, but it is equally true that at transformation it comes to the surface, and is most
  evidently as perfect an eye as could be desired. There is not the slightest sign of any
  degeneration or abortion, but simply of normal development, which takes a longer time than usual,
  lasting as it does throughout the life-time of the larval form.</p>

  <p>Kohl, who has especially studied degenerated vertebrate eyes, discusses with considerable
  fulness the question of the Ammoc&#x0153;tes eye, and concludes that in aborted eyes a retarded
  development occurs, and this applies on the whole to Ammoc&#x0153;tes, "but with the important
  difference that in this case the period of retarded development is not followed by a stoppage, but
  on the contrary by a period of very highly intensified progressive development during the
  metamorphosis," with the result that "the adult eye of <i>Petromyzon Planeri</i> does not diverge
  from the ordinary type."</p>

  <p>Referring in his summing up to this retarded development, he says: "Such reminiscences of
  embryonic conditions are after all present here and there in normally developed organs, and by no
  means entitle us to speak of abnormal development."</p>

  <p>The evidence, then, is quite clear that the eye of Petromyzon, or, indeed, of the full-grown
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, is in no sense an abnormal eye, but simply that its development is slow during
  the ammoc&#x0153;te stage. The retina of Petromyzon was figured and described by Langerhans in
  1873. He describes it as composed of the following layers<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

      <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Fig. 41.&mdash;Retina and Optic Nerve of Petromyzon. (After
      M√ºller and Langerhans.)</span></p>
      <p class="sp0">On the left side the M√ºllerian fibres and pigment-epithelium are represented
      alone. The retina is divided into an epithelial part, <i>C</i> (the layer of visual
      rod-cells), and a neurodermal or cerebral part which is formed of, <i>A</i>, the ganglion of
      the optic nerve and, <i>B</i>, the ganglion of the retina. 1, int. limiting membrane; 2, int.
      molecular layer with its two layers of cells; 3, layer of optic nerve fibres; 4, int. nuclear
      layer; 5, double row of tangential fulcrum cells; 6, layer of terminal retinal fibres; 7, ext.
      nuclear layer; 8, ext. limiting membrane; 9, layer of rods; 10, layer of pigment-epithelium.
      <i>D</i>, axial cell layer (Axenstrang) in optic nerve. The layer 6 is drawn rather too
      thick.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He points out especially the peculiarity of layer (2) (2, Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>), the
  inner molecular, in which two rows of nuclei are arranged with great regularity, the one row
  closely touching the <i>membrana limitans interna</i>, the other at the inner boundary of the
  middle third of the <span class="pagenum" id="page96">{96}</span>molecular layer. Of these two
  rows of nuclei, he describes the innermost as composed almost entirely of large nuclei belonging
  to ganglion cells, while the outermost is composed mainly of distinctly smaller nuclei, which in
  staining and appearance appear to belong not to nerve-cells but to the true reticular tissue of
  the molecular layer.</p>

  <p>He also draws special attention to the remarkable layer (5) (5, Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>),
  which is not found in the retina of the higher vertebrates, the cells of which, in his opinion,
  are of the nature of ganglion-cells.</p>

  <p>W. M√ºller, in 1874, gave a most careful description of the eye of Ammoc&#x0153;tes and
  Petromyzon, and traced the development of the retina; the subsequent paper of Kohl does not add
  anything new, and his drawings are manifestly diagrams, and do not represent the appearances so
  accurately as M√ºller's illustrations. In the accompanying figure (Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>) I
  reproduce on the right-hand side M√ºller's picture of the retina of Petromyzon, but have drawn it,
  as in Langerhans' picture, at the place of entry of the optic nerve.</p>

  <p>From his comparison of this retina with a large number of other vertebrate retinas, he comes to
  the conclusion that the retina of all vertebrates is divisible into</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p><i>A.</i> An ectodermal (epithelial) part consisting of the layer of the visual cells,
    and</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>B.</i> A neurodermal (cerebral) part which forms the rest of the retina.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Further, M√ºller points out that the neuroderm gives origin throughout the central nervous
  system to two totally different structures, on the one hand to the true nervous elements, on the
  other to a system of supporting cells and fibres which cannot be classed as connective tissue, for
  they do not arise from mesoblast, and are therefore called by him 'fulcrum-cells.' In the retina
  he recognizes two distinct groups of such supporting structures&mdash;(1) a system of radial
  fibres with well-marked elongated nuclei, which extend between the two limiting layers, and form
  at their outer ends a membrane-like expansion which was originally the outer limit of the retina,
  but becomes afterwards co-terminous with the <i>membrana limitans externa</i>, owing to the
  piercing through it of the external limbs of the rods. This system, which is known by the name of
  the radial M√ºllerian fibres (shown on the left-hand side of Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>), has no
  connection with (2) the spongioblasts and neurospongium, which form a framework of neuroglia, in
  which the terminations of the <span class="pagenum" id="page97">{97}</span>optic ganglion and of
  the retinal ganglion ramify to form the molecular layers.</p>

  <p>It is evident from Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a> that the retina of Ammoc&#x0153;tes and
  Petromyzon differs in a striking manner from the typical vertebrate retina. The epithelial part
  (C) remains the same&mdash;viz. the visual rods, the external limiting membrane, and the external
  nuclear layer; but the cerebral part, the retinal ganglion (A and B), is remarkably different. It
  is true, it consists in the main of the small-celled mass known as the inner nuclear layer, and of
  the reticulated tissue or 'neuropil' known as the inner molecular layer, just as in all other
  compound retinal eyes; but neither the ganglion cell-layer nor the optic fibre-layer is clearly
  defined as separate from this molecular layer; on the contrary, it is matter of dispute as to what
  cells represent the ganglionic layer of higher vertebrates, and the optic fibres do not form a
  distinct innermost layer, but pass into the inner molecular layer at its junction with the inner
  nuclear layer. A comparison of this innermost part of the retina (A, Fig. 41), with the
  corresponding part in Berger's picture of Musca (<i>n.l.o.g.</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig38">38</a>),
  shows a most striking similarity between the two. In both cases the fibres of the optic nerve
  (<i>O.n.</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig38">38</a>) which cross at their entrance pass into the 'neuropil'
  of this part of the retinal ganglion, and are connected probably (though that is not proved in
  either case) with the cells of the ganglionic layer. In both cases we find two well-marked
  parallel rows of cells in this part of the retina, of which one, the innermost, is composed in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes of large ganglion-cells, and the other mainly of smaller, deeper staining cells
  apparently supporting in function. Similarly, also, in Branchipus, as I conclude from my own
  observations as well as from those of Berger and Claus, the ganglionic layer is composed partly of
  true ganglion-cells and partly of supporting cells arranged in a distinct layer. This part, then,
  of the retina of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is remarkably like that of a typical arthropod retina, and forms
  that part of the retinal ganglion which may be called the ganglion of the optic nerve.</p>

  <p>Next comes the ganglion of the retina (B, Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>) (Parker's first optic
  ganglion), the cells of which form the small bipolar granule-cells of the inner nuclear layer;
  granule-cells arranged in rows just as they are shown in Claus' picture of the same layer in the
  retina of Branchipus (Fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>), just as they are found in the cortical layers
  of the optic ganglion of the pineal eye (<i>ganglion habenul√¶</i>), in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page98">{98}</span>optic lobes and other parts of the Ammoc&#x0153;tes brain, or in the
  cortical layers of the optic ganglia of all arthropods.</p>

  <p>Between this small-celled nuclear layer (4, Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>) and the layer of
  nuclei of the visual rod cells (7, Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>) (the external nuclear layer), we
  find in the eye of Ammoc&#x0153;tes and Petromyzon two well-marked rows of cells of a most
  striking character&mdash;viz. the two remarkably regular rows of large epithelial-like cells with
  large conspicuous nuclei, which give the appearance of two opposing rows of limiting epithelium
  (5, Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>), already mentioned in connection with the researches of
  Langerhans and W. M√ºller. Here, then, is a striking peculiarity of the retina of the lamprey, and
  according to M√ºller the obliteration of these two layers can be traced as we pass upwards in the
  vertebrate kingdom. Among fishes, they are especially well seen in the perch; in the higher
  vertebrates the whole layer is only a rudiment represented, he thinks, by the simple layer of
  round cells which lies close against the inner surface of the layer of terminal fibres
  (Nervenans√§tze), and is especially evident in birds and reptiles. In man and the higher mammals
  they are probably represented by the horizontal cells of the outer part of the inner nuclear
  layer.</p>

  <p>Seeing, then, that they are most evident in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and become less and less marked
  in the higher vertebrates, it is clear that their origin cannot be sought among the animals higher
  in the scale than Ammoc&#x0153;tes, but must, therefore, be searched for in the opposite
  direction.</p>

  <p>M√ºller describes them as forming a very conspicuous landmark in the embryology of the retina,
  dividing it distinctly into two parts, an outer thinner, and an inner somewhat thicker part, the
  zone formed by them standing out conspicuously on account of the size and regularity of the cells
  and their lighter appearance when stained. Thus in his description of the retina of an
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes 95 mm. in length, he says, "The layer of pale tangentially elongated cells formed
  a double layer and produced the appearance of a pale, very characteristic zone between the outer
  and inner parts of the retina."</p>

  <p>Let us now turn to the retina of the crustacean and see whether there is any evidence there
  that the retina is divisible into an outer and inner part, separated by a zone of
  characteristically pale staining cells with conspicuous nuclei. The most elaborate description of
  the development of the retina of Astacus is given by Reichenbach, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page99">{99}</span>according to whom the earliest sign of the formation of the retina is an
  ectodermic involution (Augen-einst√ºlpung), which soon closes, so that the retinal area appears as
  a thickening. In close contiguity to this thickening, the thickening of the optic ganglion arises,
  so that that part of the optic ganglion which will form the retinal ganglion fuses with the
  thickened optic plate and forms a single mass of tissue. Later on a fold (Augen-falte) appears in
  this mass of tissue, in consequence of which it becomes divided into two parts. The lining walls
  of this fold form a double row of cells, the nuclei of which are most conspicuous because they are
  larger and lighter in colour than the surrounding nuclei, so that by this fold the retina is
  divided into an outer and an inner wall, the line of demarcation being conspicuous by reason of
  these two rows of large, lightly-staining nuclei.</p>

  <p>Reichenbach is unable to say that this secondary fold is coincident with the primary
  involution, and that therefore the junction between the two rows of large pale nuclei is the line
  of junction between the retinal ganglion and the retina proper, because all sign of the primary
  involution is lost before the secondary fold appears.</p>

  <p>Parker compares the appearances in the lobster with Reichenbach's description in the crayfish,
  and says that he finds only a thickening, no primary involution; at the same time he expressly
  states that in the very early stages his material was deficient, and that he had not grounds
  sufficient to warrant the statement that no involution occurs. He also finds that in the lobster
  the ganglionic tissue which arises by proliferation is divided into an outer and inner part; the
  separation is effected by a band of large, lightly-staining nuclei, which, in position and
  structure, resemble the band figured by Reichenbach. According to Parker, then, the line of
  separation indicated in the development by Reichenbach's outer and inner walls is not the line of
  junction between the retina and the retinal ganglion, as Reichenbach was inclined to think, but
  rather a separation of two rows of large ganglion-cells belonging to the retinal ganglion.</p>

  <p>The similarity between these conspicuous layers of lightly-staining cells in Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  and in crustaceans is remarkably close, and in both cases observers have found the same difficulty
  in interpreting their meaning. In each case one group of observers looks upon them as
  ganglion-cells, the other as supporting structures. Thus in the lamprey, M√ºller considers them to
  belong to the supporting elements, while Langerhans and Kohl describe them as a double <span
  class="pagenum" id="page100">{100}</span>layer of ganglion-cells. In the crustacean, Berger in
  Squilla, Grenacher in Mysis, and Parker in Astacus, look upon them as supporting elements, while
  Viallanes in Palinurus considers them to be true ganglionic cells.</p>

  <p>Whatever the final interpretation of these cells may prove to be, we may, it seems to me,
  represent an ideal compound retina of the crustacean type by combining the investigations of
  Berger, Claus, Reichenbach, and Parker in the following figure.</p>

  <p>The comparison of this figure (Fig. <a href="#fig42">42</a>) with that of the Petromyzon retina
  (Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>) shows how great is the similarity of the latter with the arthropod
  type, and how the very points in which it deviates from the recognized vertebrate type are
  explainable by comparison with that of the arthropod. The most striking difference between the
  retinas in the two figures is that the layer of terminal nerve fibres (5, Fig. <a
  href="#fig42">42</a>), which, after all, are only the elongated terminations of the retinal cells
  belonging to Parker's neurones of the first order, is very much longer than in Petromyzon or in
  any vertebrate, for the external molecular layer (6, Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>) (M√ºller's layer
  of Nervenans√§tze) is very short and inconspicuous (in Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a> it is drawn too
  thick).</p>

  <p>Turning from the retina to the fibres of the optic nerve we again find a remarkable
  resemblance, for in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, as pointed out by <span class="pagenum"
  id="page101">{101}</span>Langerhans and carefully figured by Kohl, a crossing of the fibres of the
  optic nerve occurs as the nerve leaves the retina, just as is so universally the case in all
  compound retinas. To this crossing Kohl has given the name <i>chiasma nervi optici</i>, in
  distinction to the cerebral chiasma, which he calls <i>chiasma nervorum opticorum</i>. Further, we
  find that even this latter chiasma is well represented in the arthropod brain; thus Bellonci in
  Sph√¶roma, Berger, Dietl, and Krieger in Astacus, all describe a true optic chiasma, the only
  difference in opinion being, whether the crossing of the optic nerves is complete or not.
  Especially instructive are Bellonci's figures and description. He describes the brain of Sph√¶roma
  as composed of three segments&mdash;a superior segment, the cerebrum proper, a middle segment, and
  an inferior segment; the optic fibres, as is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig39">39</a>, after crossing,
  pass direct into the middle segment, in the ganglia of which they terminate. From this segment
  also arises the nerve to the first antenna of that side&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the olfactory nerve. The
  optic part, then, of this middle segment is clearly the brain portion of the optic ganglionic
  apparatus, and may be called the optic lobes, in contradistinction to the peripheral part, which
  is usually called the optic ganglion, and is composed of two ganglia, Op. g. I. and Op. g. II., as
  already mentioned. These optic lobes are therefore homologous with the optic lobes of the
  vertebrate brain.</p>

  <p>The resemblance throughout is so striking as to force one to the conclusion that the retina of
  the vertebrate eye is a compound retina, composed of a retina and retinal ganglion of the type
  found in arthropods. From this it follows that the development of the vertebrate retina ought to
  show the formation of (1) an optic plate formed from the peripheral epidermis and not from the
  brain; (2) a part of the brain closely attached to this optic plate forming the retinal ganglion,
  which remains at the surface when the rest of the optic ganglion withdraws; (3) an optic nerve
  formed in consequence of this withdrawal, as the connection between the retinal and cerebral parts
  of the optic ganglion.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This appears to me exactly what the developmental process does show according to
  G√∂tte's investigations. He asserts that the retina arises from an optic plate, being the optical
  portion of his 'Sinnes-platte.' At an early stage this is separated by a furrow (Furche) from the
  general mass of epidermal cells which ultimately form the brain. This separation then vanishes,
  and the retina and brain-mass <span class="pagenum" id="page102">{102}</span>become inextricably
  united into a mass of cells, which are still situated at the surface. By the closure of the
  cephalic plate and the withdrawal of the brain away from the surface, a retinal mass of cells is
  left at the surface connected with the tubular central nervous system by the hollow optic
  diverticulum or primary optic vesicle. If we regard only the retinal and nervous elements, and for
  the moment pay no attention to the existence of the tube, G√∂tte's observation that the true retina
  has been formed from the optic plate (Sinnes-platte) to which the retinal portion of the brain
  (retinal ganglion) has become firmly fixed, and that then the optic nerve has been formed by the
  withdrawal of the rest of the brain (optic lobes), is word for word applicable to the description
  of the development of the compound retina of the arthropod eye, as has been already stated.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Significance of the Optic Diverticula.</span></p>

  <p>The origin of the retina from an optic epidermal plate in vertebrates, as in all other animals,
  brings the cephalic eyes of all animals into the same category, and leaves the vertebrate eye no
  longer in an isolated and unnatural position. In one point the retina of the vertebrate eye
  differs from that of a compound retina of an invertebrate; in the former, a striking supporting
  tissue exists, known as M√ºller's fibres, which is absent in the latter. This difference of
  structure is closely associated with another of the same character as in the central nervous
  system, viz. the apparent development of the nervous part from a tube. We see, in fact, that the
  retinal and nervous arrangements of the vertebrate eye are comparable with those of the arthropod
  eye, in precisely the same way and to the same extent as the nervous matter of the brain of the
  vertebrate is comparable with the brain of the arthropod. In both cases the nervous matter is, in
  structure, position, and function, absolutely homologous; in both cases there is found in the
  vertebrate something extra which is not found in the invertebrate&mdash;viz. a hollow tube, the
  walls of which, in the case of the brain, are utilized as supporting tissues for the nerve
  structures. The explanation of this difference in the case of the brain is the fundamental idea of
  my whole theory, namely, that the hollow tube is in reality the cephalic stomach of the
  invertebrate, around which the nervous brain-matter was originally grouped in precisely the same
  manner as in the invertebrate. What, then, are the optic diverticula?</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page103">{103}</span></div>

  <p>"The formation of the eye," as taught by Balfour, "commences with the appearance of a pair of
  hollow outgrowths from the anterior cerebral vesicle. These outgrowths, known as the optic
  vesicles, at first open freely into the cavity of the anterior cerebral vesicle. From this they
  soon, however, become partially constricted, and form vesicles united to the base of the brain by
  comparatively narrow, hollow stalks, the rudiments of the optic nerves."</p>

  <p>"After the establishment of the optic nerves, there takes place (1) the formation of the lens,
  and (2) the formation of the optic cup from the walls of the primary optic vesicle."</p>

  <p>He then goes on to explain how the formation of the lens forms the optic cup with its double
  walls from the primary optic vesicle, and says&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Of its double walls, the inner, or anterior, is formed from the front portion, the outer, or
  posterior, from the hind portion of the wall of the primary optic vesicle. The inner, or anterior,
  which very speedily becomes thicker than the other, is converted into the retina; in the outer, or
  posterior, which remains thin, pigment is eventually deposited, and it ultimately becomes the
  tesselated pigment-layer of the choroid."</p>

  <p>The difficulties in connection with this view of the origin of the eye are exceedingly great,
  so great as to have caused Balfour to discuss seriously Lankester's suggestion that the eye must
  have been at one time within the brain, and that the ancestor of the vertebrate was therefore a
  transparent animal, so that light might get to the eye through the outer covering and the
  brain-mass; a suggestion, the unsatisfactory nature of which Balfour himself confessed. Is there
  really evidence of any part of either retina or optic nerve being formed from the epithelial
  lining of the tube?</p>

  <p>This tube is formed as a direct continuation of the tube of the central nervous system, and we
  can therefore apply to it the same arguments as have been used in the discussion of the meaning of
  the latter tube. Now, the striking point in the latter case is the fact that the lining membrane
  of the central canal is in so many parts absolutely free from nervous matter, and so shows, as in
  the so-called choroid plexuses, its simple, non-nervous epithelial structure. This also we find in
  the optic diverticulum. Where there is no evidence of any invasion of the tube by nervous
  elements, there it retains its simple non-nervous character of a tube composed of a single layer
  of <span class="pagenum" id="page104">{104}</span>epithelial cells&mdash;viz. in that part of the
  tube which, as Balfour says, remains thin, in which pigment is eventually deposited, and which
  ultimately becomes the tesselated pigment-layer of the choroid. Nobody has ever suggested that
  this pigment-layer is nervous matter, or ever was, or ever will be, nervous matter; it is in
  precisely the same category as the membranous roof of the brain in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, which never
  was, and never will be, nervous matter. Yet, according to the old embryology both in the case of
  the eye and the brain, the pigment-layer and the so-called choroid plexuses are a part of the
  tubular nervous system.</p>

  <p>Turning now to the optic nerve, Balfour describes it as derived from the hollow stalk of the
  optic vesicle. He says&mdash;</p>

  <p>"At first the optic nerve is equally continuous with both walls of the optic cup, as must of
  necessity be the case, since the interval which primarily exists between the two walls is
  continuous with the cavity of the stalk. When the cavity within the optic nerve vanishes, and the
  fibres of the optic nerve appear, all connection is ruptured between the outer wall of the optic
  cup and the optic nerve, and the optic nerve simply perforates the outer wall, and becomes
  continuous with the inner one."</p>

  <p>In this description Balfour, because he derived the optic nerve fibres from the epithelial wall
  of the optic stalk, of necessity supposed that such fibres originally supplied both the outer and
  inner walls of the optic cup and, therefore, seeing that when the fibres of the optic nerve appear
  they do not supply the outer wall, he supposes that their original connection with the outer wall
  is ruptured, because a discontinuity of the epithelial lining takes place coincidently with the
  appearance of the optic nerve-fibres, and, according to him, the optic nerve simply perforates the
  outer wall and becomes continuous with the inner one. This last statement is very difficult to
  understand. I presume he meant that some of the fibres of the optic nerve supplied from the
  beginning the inner wall of the optic cup, but that others which originally supplied the outer
  wall were first ruptured, then perforated the outer wall, and finally completed the supply to the
  inner wall or retina.</p>

  <p>This statement of Balfour's is the necessary consequence of his belief, that the epithelial
  cells of the optic stalk gave rise to the fibres of the optic nerve. If, instead of this, we
  follow K√∂lliker and His, who state that the optic nerve-fibres are formed outside the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page105">{105}</span>epithelial walls of the optic stalk, and that the cells
  of the latter form supporting structures for the nerve-fibres, then the position of the optic
  nerve becomes perfectly simple and satisfactory without any rupturing of its connection with the
  outer wall and subsequent perforation, for the optic nerve-fibres from their very first appearance
  pass directly to supply the retina&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the inner wall of the optic cup and nothing
  else.</p>

  <p>They pass, as is well known, without any perforation by way of the choroidal slit to the inner
  surface of the inner wall (retina) of the optic cup; then, when the choroidal slit becomes closed
  by the expansion of the optic cup, the optic nerve naturally becomes situated in the centre of the
  base of the cup and spreads over its inner surface as that surface expands.</p>

  <p>A section across the optic cup at an early stage at the junction of the optic stalk and optic
  cup would be represented by the upper diagram in Fig. 43; at a later stage, when the choroidal
  slit is closed, by the lower diagram.</p>

  <p>The evident truth of this manner of looking at the origin of the optic nerve is demonstrated by
  the appearance of the optic nerve in Ammoc&#x0153;tes and Petromyzon. In the latter, although the
  development is complete, and the eye, and consequently also the optic nerve-fibres, are fully
  functional, there is still present in the axial core of the nerve a row of epithelial cells
  (Axenstrang) which are altered so as to form supporting structures, in the same way as a row of
  epithelial cells in the retina is altered to form the system of supporting cells known by the name
  of the M√ºllerian fibres.</p>

  <p>The origin of this axial core of cells is perfectly clear, as has been pointed out by W.
  M√ºller. He says&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The development of the optic nerve shows peculiarities in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page106">{106}</span>Petromyzon of such a character as to make this animal one of the most
  valuable objects for deciding the various controversial questions connected with the genesis of
  its elements. The lumen of the stalk of the primary optic vesicle is obliterated quite early by a
  proliferation of its lining epithelium. Also the original continuity of this epithelium with that
  of the pigment-layer is at an early period interrupted at the point of attachment of the optic
  stalk. This interruption occurs at the time when the fibres of the optic nerve first become
  visible."</p>

  <p>Further on he says&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The epithelium of the optic stalk develops entirely into supporting cells, which in Petromyzon
  fill up the original lumen and so form an axial core (Axenstrang) to the nerve-fibres which are
  formed entirely outside them; the projections of these supporting cells are directed towards the
  periphery, and so separate the bundles of the optic nerve-fibres. The mesodermal coat of the optic
  stalk takes no part in this separation; it simply forms the connective tissue sheath of the optic
  nerve. The development of the optic nerve in the higher vertebrates also obeys the same law, as I
  am bound to conclude from my own observations."</p>

  <p>The evidence, then, of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is very conclusive. Originally a tube composed of a
  single layer of epithelial cells became expanded at the anterior end to form a bulb. On the
  outside of this tube or stalk the fibres of the optic nerve make their appearance, arising from
  the ganglion-cell layer of the retina, and, passing over the surface of the epithelial tube at the
  choroidal fissure, proceed to the brain by way of the optic chiasma. Owing to the large number of
  fibres, their crossing at the junction of the stalk with the bulb, and the narrowness at this
  neck, the obliteration of the lumen of the tube which takes place in the stalk is carried out to a
  still greater extent at this narrow part. The result of this is that all continuity of the
  cell-layers of the original tube of the optic stalk with those of both the inner and outer walls
  of the bulb is interrupted, and all that remains in this spot of the original continuous line of
  cells which connected the tube of the stalk with that of the bulb are possibly some of the groups
  of cells which are found scattered among the fibres of the optic nerve at their entrance into the
  retina. Such separation of the originally continuous elements of the epithelial wall of the optic
  stalk, which is apparent only at this neck of the nerve in Petromyzon, takes place <span
  class="pagenum" id="page107">{107}</span>along the whole of the optic nerve in the higher
  vertebrates, so that no continuous axial core of cells exist, but only scattered supporting
  cells.</p>

  <p>If further proof in support of this view be wanted, it is given by the evidence of physiology,
  which shows that the fibres of the optic nerve are not different from other nerve-fibres of the
  central nervous system, but that they degenerate when separated from their nerve-cell, and that
  the nerve-cell of which the optic nerve-fibre is a process is the large ganglion-cell of the
  ganglionic layer of the retina. The origin of the ganglionic layer of the retina cannot therefore
  be separated from that of the optic nerve-fibres. If the one is outside the epithelial tube, so is
  the other, and what holds true of the ganglionic layer must hold good of the rest of the retinal
  ganglion and, from all that has been said, of the retina itself. We therefore come to the
  conclusion that the evidence is distinctly in favour of the view, that the retina and optic nerve
  in the true sense are structures which originally were outside a non-nervous tube, but, just like
  the central nervous system as a whole, have amalgamated so closely with the elements of this tube
  as to utilize them for supporting structures. One part of this non-nervous tube, its dorsal wall,
  like the corresponding part of the brain-tube, still retains its original character, and by the
  deposition of pigment has been pressed into the service of the eye to form the pigmented
  epithelial layer.</p>

  <p>We can, however, go further than this, for we know definitely in the case of the retina what
  the fate of the epithelial cells lining this tube has been. They have become the system of
  supporting structures known as M√ºllerian fibres.</p>

  <p>The epithelial layer of the primary optic vesicle can be traced into direct continuity with the
  lining epithelium of the brain cavity, as a single layer of epithelial cells in the core of the
  optic nerve, forming the optic stalk, which, in consequence of close contact, becomes the
  well-known axial layer of supporting cells. This epithelial layer of the optic stalk then expands
  to form the optic bulb, the outer or dorsal wall of which still remains as a single layer of
  epithelium and becomes the layer of pigment epithelium. This layer of epithelium becomes doubled
  on itself by the approximation of the inner or ventral wall of the optic cup to the outer or
  dorsal wall in consequence of the presence of the lens, and still remaining a single layer, forms
  the <i>pars ciliaris retin√¶</i>; then suddenly, at the <i>ora <span class="pagenum"
  id="page108">{108}</span>serrata</i>, the single epithelial layer vanishes, and the layers of the
  retina take its place. It has long been known, however, that even throughout the retina this
  single epithelial layer still continues, being known as the fibres of M√ºller. This is how the fact
  is described in the last edition of Foster's "Text-book of Physiology," p. 1308&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Stretching radially from the inner to the outer limiting membrane in all regions of the retina
  are certain peculiar-shaped bodies known as the radial fibres of M√ºller. Each fibre is the outcome
  of the changes undergone by what was at first a simple columnar epithelial cell. The changes are,
  in the main, that the columnar form is elongated into that of a more or less prismatic fibre, the
  edges of which become variously branched, and that while the nucleus is retained the cell
  substance becomes converted into neuro-keratin. And, indeed, at the <i>ora serrata</i> the fibres
  of M√ºller may be seen suddenly to lose their peculiar features and to pass into the ordinary
  columnar cells which form the <i>pars ciliaris retin√¶</i>."</p>

  </div>

  <p>It is then absolutely clear that the essential parts of the eye may be considered as composed
  of two parts&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. A tube or diverticulum from the tube of the central nervous system, composed throughout of a
  single layer of epithelium, which forms the supporting axial cells in the optic nerve, the pigment
  epithelium and the M√ºllerian fibres of the retina. Such a tube would be represented by the
  accompanying Fig. <a href="#fig44">44</a>, and the left side of Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>.</p>

  <p>2. The retina proper with the retinal ganglion and the optic nerve-fibres as already described.
  In this part supporting elements are found, just as in any other compound retina, of the nature of
  neuroglia, which are independent of the M√ºllerian fibres.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page109">{109}</span></div>

  <p>Of these two parts we have already seen that the second is to all intents and purposes a
  compound retina of a crustacean eye, and seeing that the single-layered epithelial tube is
  continuous with the single-layered epithelial tube of the central nervous system&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
  with the cephalic part of the gut of the arthropod ancestor&mdash;it follows with certainty that
  the ancestor of the vertebrates must have possessed two anterior diverticula of the gut, with the
  wall of which, near the anterior extremity, the compound retina has amalgamated on either side,
  just as the infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia have amalgamated with the ventral wall of the main
  gut-tube. In this way, and in this way alone, does the interpretation of the structure of the
  vertebrate lateral eye harmonize in the most perfect manner with the rest of the conclusions
  already arrived at.</p>

  <p>The question therefore arises:&mdash;Have we any grounds for believing that the ancient forms
  of primitive crustaceans and primitive arachnids, which were so abundant in the time when the
  Cephalaspids appeared, possessed two anterior diverticula of the stomach, such as the
  consideration of the vertebrate eye strongly indicates must have been the case?</p>

  <p>The beautiful pictures of Blanchard, and his description, show how, on the arachnid side,
  paired diverticula of the stomach are nearly universal in the group. Thus, although they are not
  present in the scorpions, still, in the Thelyphonid√¶, Phrynid√¶, Solpugid√¶, Mygalid√¶, the most
  marked characteristic of the stomach-region is the presence of four pairs of c&#x0153;cal
  diverticula, which spread laterally over the prosomatic region. In the spiders the number of such
  diverticula increases, and the whole prosomatic region becomes filled up with these tubes.
  Blanchard considers that they form nutrient tubes for the direct nutrition of the organs in the
  prosoma, especially the important brain-region of the central nervous system. He points out that
  these animals are blood-suckers, and that, therefore, their food is already in a suitable form for
  purposes of nutrition when it is taken in by them, so that, as it were, the anterior part of the
  gut is transformed into a series of vessels or diverticula conveying blood directly to the
  important organs in the prosoma, by means of which they obtain nourishment in addition to their
  own blood-supply.</p>

  <p>The universality of such diverticula among the arachnids makes it highly probable that their
  progenitors did possess an alimentary canal with one or more pairs of anterior diverticula. In the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page110">{110}</span>vertebrate, however, the paired diverticula are
  associated with a compound retina, a combination which does not occur among living arachnids; we
  must, therefore, examine the crustacean group for the desired combination, and naturally the most
  likely group to examine is the Phyllopoda, especially such primitive forms as Branchipus and
  Artemia, for it is universally acknowledged that these forms are the nearest living
  representatives of the trilobites. If, therefore, it be found that the retina and optic nerve in
  Artemia is in specially close connection with an anterior diverticulum of the gut on each side,
  then it is almost certain that such a combination existed also in the trilobites.</p>

  <p>My friend Mr. W. B. Hardy has especially investigated the nervous system of Artemia. In the
  course of his work he cut serial sections through the whole animal, and, as mentioned in my paper
  in the <i>Journal of Anatomy and Physiology</i>, he discovered that the retinal ganglion of each
  lateral eye is so closely attached to the end of the corresponding diverticulum of the gut that
  the lining cells of the ventral part of the diverticulum form a lining to the retinal ganglion
  (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>). In this animal there are only two gut-diverticula, which are
  situated most anteriorly. I have plotted out this series of sections by means of a camera lucida,
  with the result that the retina appears as a bulging attached ventro-laterally to the extremity of
  each gut-diverticulum, as is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig46">46</a>. It is instructive to compare
  with this figure Scott's picture of the developing eye in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, where he figures the
  retina as <span class="pagenum" id="page112">{112}</span>a bulging attached ventrally to the
  extremity of the narrow tube of the optic diverticulum. In Fig. <a href="#fig47">47</a>, A, I
  reproduce this figure of Scott, and by the side of it, Fig. <a href="#fig47">47</a>, B, I have
  represented the origin of the vertebrate eye as I believe it to have occurred.</p>

  <p>We see, then, this very striking fact, that in the most primitive of the Crustacea, not only
  are there two anterior diverticula of the gut, but also the retinal ganglion of the lateral eye is
  in specially close connection with the end of the diverticulum on each side. In fact, we find in
  the nearest living representative of the trilobites a retina and retinal ganglion and optic nerve,
  closely resembling that of the vertebrate, in close connection with an epithelial tube which has
  nothing to do with the organ of sight, but is one of a pair of anterior gut-diverticula. It is
  impossible to obtain more decisive evidence that the trilobites possessed a pair of
  gut-diverticula surrounded to a greater or less extent by the retina and optic nerve of each
  lateral eye.</p>

  <p>Such anterior diverticula are commonly found in the lower Crustacea; they are usually known by
  the name of liver-diverticula, but as they take no part in digestion, and, on the contrary,
  represent that part of the gut which is most active in absorption, the term liver is not
  appropriate, and it is therefore better to call them simply the pair of anterior diverticula. Our
  knowledge of their function in Daphnia is given in a paper by Hardy and M&lsquo;Dougall, which
  does not appear to be widely known. Hardy succeeded in feeding Daphnia with yolk of egg in which
  carmine grains were mixed, and was able in the living animal to watch the whole process of
  deglutition, digestion, and absorption. The food, which is made into a bolus, is moved down to the
  middle region of the gut, and there digestion takes place. Then by an antiperistaltic movement the
  more fluid products of the digestion-process are sent right forward into the two anterior
  diverticula, where the single layer of columnar cells lining these diverticula absorbs these
  products, the cells becoming thickly studded with fat-drops after a feed of yolk of egg. The
  carmine particles, which were driven forward with the proteid- and fat-particles, are not
  absorbed, but are at intervals driven back by contractions of the anterior diverticula to the
  middle region of the gut.</p>

  <p>These observations prove most clearly that the anterior diverticula have a special nutrient
  function, being the main channels by which new nutrient material is brought into the body, and, as
  <span class="pagenum" id="page113">{113}</span>pointed out by the authors, it is a remarkable
  exception in the animal kingdom that absorption should occur in that portion of the gut which is
  anterior to the part in which digestion occurs. In all these animals the two anterior diverticula
  extend forwards over the brain, and, as we have seen in Artemia, the anterior extremity of each
  one is so intimately related to a part of the brain&mdash;viz. the retinal ganglion&mdash;as to
  form a lining membrane to that mass of nerve-cells. It follows, therefore, that the nutrient fluid
  absorbed by the cells of this part of the gut-diverticulum must be primarily for the service of
  the retinal ganglion. In fact, the relations of this anterior portion of the gut to the brain as a
  whole suggest strongly that the marked absorptive function of this anterior portion of the gut
  exists in order to supply nutrient material in the first place to the most vital, most important
  organ in the animal&mdash;the brain and its sense-organs. This conclusion is borne out by the fact
  that in these lower crustaceans the circulation of blood is of a very inefficient character, so
  that the tissues are mainly dependent for their nutrition on the fluid immediately surrounding
  them. It stands to reason that the establishment of the anterior portion of the gut as a nutrient
  tube to the brain would necessitate a closer and closer application of the brain to that tube, so
  that the process of amalgamation of the brain with the single layer of columnar epithelial cells
  which constitutes the wall of the gut (which we see in its initial stage in the retinal ganglion
  of Artemia), would tend rapidly to increase as more and more demands were made upon the brain,
  until at last both the supra- and infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, as well as the retinal ganglia
  and optic nerves, were in such close intimate connection with the ventral wall of the anterior
  portion of the gut and its diverticula as to form a brain and retina closely resembling that of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>Such an origin for the lateral eyes of the vertebrate explains in a simple and satisfactory
  manner why the vertebrate retina is a compound retina, and why both retina and optic nerve have an
  apparent tubular development.</p>

  <p>At the same time one discrepancy still exists which requires consideration&mdash;viz. in no
  arthropod eye possessing a compound retina is the retina inverted. All the known cases of
  inversion among arthropods occur in eyes, the retina of which is simple, and are all natural
  consequences of the process of invagination by which <span class="pagenum"
  id="page114">{114}</span>the retina is formed. On the other hand, eyes with an inverted compound
  retina are not entirely unknown among invertebrates, for the eyes of Pecten and of Spondylus
  possess a retina which is inverted after the vertebrate fashion and still may be spoken of as
  compound rather than simple. It is clear that an invagination, the effect of which is an inversion
  of the retinal layer, would lead to the same result, whether the retinal optic nerves were short
  or long, whether, in fact, a retinal ganglion existed or not. Undoubtedly the presence of the
  retinal ganglion tends greatly to obscure any process of invagination, so that, as already
  mentioned, many observers, with Parker, consider the retina of the crustacean lateral eye to be
  formed by a thickening only, without any invagination, while Reichenbach says an obscure
  invagination does take place at a very early stage. So in the vertebrate eye most observers speak
  only of a thickening to form the retina, but G√∂tte's observation points to an invagination of the
  optic plate at an early stage. So also in the eye of Pecten, Korschelt and Heider consider that
  the thickening, by which the retina is formed according to Patten, in reality hides an
  invagination process by means of which, as B√ºtschli suggests, an optic vesicle is formed in the
  usual manner. The retina is formed from the anterior wall of this vesicle, and is therefore
  inverted.</p>

  <p>The origin of the inverted retina of the vertebrate eye does not seem to me to present any
  great difficulty, especially when one takes into consideration the fact that the retina is
  inverted in the arachnid group, only in the lateral eyes. The inversion is usually regarded as
  associated with the tubular formation of the vertebrate retina, and it is possible to suppose that
  the retina became inverted in consequence of the involvement of the eye with the gut-diverticulum.
  I do not myself think any such explanation is at all probable, because I cannot conceive such a
  process taking place without a temporary derangement&mdash;to say the least of it&mdash;of the
  power of vision, and as I do not believe that evolution was brought about by sudden, startling
  changes, but by gradual, orderly adaptations, and as I also believe in the paramount importance of
  the organs of vision for the evolution of all the higher types of the animal kingdom, I must
  believe that in the evolution from the Arthropod to the Cephalaspid, the lateral eyes remained
  throughout functional. I therefore, for my own part, would say that the inversion of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page115">{115}</span>retina took place before the complete amalgamation with
  the gut-diverticulum, that, in fact, among the proto-crustacean, proto-arachnid forms there were
  some sufficiently arachnid to have an inverted retina, and at the same time sufficiently
  crustacean to possess a compound retina, and therefore a compound inverted retina after the
  vertebrate fashion existed in combination with the anterior gut-diverticula. Thus, when the eye
  and optic nerve sank into and amalgamated with the gut-diverticulum, neither the dioptric
  apparatus nor the nervous arrangements would suffer any alteration, and the animal throughout the
  whole process would possess organs of vision as good as before or after the period of
  transition.</p>

  <p>Further, not only the retina but also the dioptric apparatus of the vertebrate eye point to its
  origin from a type that combined the peculiarities of the arachnids and the crustaceans. In the
  former it is difficult to speak of a true lens, the function of a lens being undertaken by the
  cuticular surface of the cells of the corneagen (Mark's 'lentigen'), while in the latter, in
  addition to the corneal covering, a true lens exists in the shape of the crystalline cones.
  Further, these crustacean lenses are true lenses in the vertebrate sense, in that they are formed
  by modified hypodermal cells, and not bulgings of the cuticle, as in the arachnid. We see, in
  fact, that in the compound crustacean eye an extra layer of hypodermal cells has become inserted
  between the cornea and the retina to form a lens. So also in the vertebrate eye the lens is formed
  by an extra layer of the epidermal cells between the cornea and the retina. The fact that the
  vertebrate eye possesses a single lens, though its retina is composed of a number of ommatidia,
  while the crustacean eye possesses a lens to each ommatidium, may well be a consequence of the
  inversion of the vertebrate retina. It is most probable, as Korschelt and Heider have pointed out,
  that the retina of the arachnid eyes is composed of a number of ommatidia, just as in the
  crustacean eyes and in the inverted eyes it is probable that the image is focussed on to the
  pigmented tapetal layer, and thence reflected on to the percipient visual rods. In such a method
  of vision a single lens is a necessity, and so it must also be if, as I suppose, eyes existed with
  an inverted compound retina. Owing to the crustacean affinities of such eyes, a lens would be
  formed and the retina would be compound: owing to the arachnid affinities, the retina would be
  inverted and the hypodermal cells which formed the lens would be massed <span class="pagenum"
  id="page116">{116}</span>together to form a single lens, instead of being collected in groups of
  four to form a series of crystalline cones.</p>

  <p>To sum up: The study of the vertebrate eyes, both median and lateral, leads to most important
  conclusions as to the origin of the vertebrates, for it shows clearly that whereas, as pointed out
  in this and subsequent chapters, their ancestors possessed distinct arachnid characteristics, yet
  that they cannot have been specialized arachnids, such as our present-day forms, but rather they
  were of a primitive arachnid type, with distinct crustacean characteristics: animals that were
  both crustacean and arachnid, but not yet specialized in either direction: animals, in fact, of
  precisely the kind which swarmed in the seas at the time when the vertebrates first made their
  appearance. In the opinion of the present day, the ancestral forms of the Crustacea, which were
  directly derived from the Annelida, may be classed as an hypothetical group the Protostraca, the
  nearest approach to which is a primitive Phyllopod.</p>

  <p>"Starting from the Protostraca," say Korschelt and Heider, "according to the present condition
  of our knowledge, we may, as has been already remarked, assume three great series of development
  of the Arthropodan stock, by the side of which a number of smaller independent branches have been
  retained. One of these series leads through the hypothetical primitive Phyllopod to the Crustacea;
  the second through the Pal√¶ostraca (Trilobita, Gigantostraca, Xiphosura) to the Arachnida; the
  third through forms resembling Peripatus to the Myriapoda and the Insecta. The Pantapoda and the
  Tardigrada must probably be regarded as smaller independent branches of the Arthropodan
  stock."</p>

  <p class="sp3">To these "three great series of development of the Arthropodan stock" the evidence
  of Ammoc&#x0153;tes shows that a fourth must be added, which, starting also from the Protostraca,
  and closely connected with the second, pal√¶ostracan branch, leads through the Cephalaspid√¶ to the
  great kingdom of the Vertebrata. Such a direct linking of the earliest vertebrates with the
  Annelida through the Protostraca is of the utmost importance, as will be shown later in the
  explanation of the origin of the vertebrate c&#x0153;lom and urinary apparatus.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>The most important discovery of recent years which gives a direct clue to the ancestry of the
    vertebrates is undoubtedly the discovery that the pineal gland is all that remains of a pair of
    median eyes which must have been functional in the immediate ancestor of the vertebrate, seeing
    how perfect one of them still is in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. The vertebrate ancestor, then, possessed
    two pairs of eyes, one pair situated laterally, the other median. In striking confirmation of
    the origin of the vertebrate from Pal√¶ostracans it is universally admitted that all the
    Eurypterids and such-like forms resembled Limulus in the possession of a pair of median eyes, as
    well as of a pair of lateral eyes. Moreover, the ancient mailed fishes the Ostracodermata, which
    are the earliest fishes known, are all said to show the presence of a pair of median eyes as
    well as of a pair of lateral eyes. This evidence directly suggests that the structure of both
    the median and lateral vertebrate eyes ought to be very similar to that of the median and
    lateral arthropod eyes. Such is, indeed, found to be the case.</p>
    <p>The retina of the simplest form of eye is formed from a group of the superficial epidermal
    cells, and the rods or rhabdites are formed from the cuticular covering of these cells; the
    optic nerve passes from these cells to the deeper-lying brain. This kind of retina may be called
    a simple retina, and characterizes the eyes, both median and lateral, of the scorpion group.</p>
    <p>In other cases a portion of the optic ganglion remains at the surface, when the brain sinks
    inwards, in close contiguity to the epidermal sense-cells which form the retina; a tract of
    fibres connects this optic ganglion with the underlying brain, and is known as the optic nerve.
    Such a retina may be called a compound retina and characterizes the lateral eyes of both
    crustaceans and vertebrates. Also, owing to the method of formation of the retina by
    invagination, the cuticular surface of the retinal sense-cells, from which the rods are formed,
    may be directed towards the source of light or away from it. In the first case the retina may be
    called upright, in the second inverted.</p>
    <p>Such inverted retinas are found in the vertebrate lateral eyes and in the lateral eyes of the
    arachnids, but not of the crustaceans.</p>
    <p>The evidence shows that all the invertebrate median eyes possess a simple upright retina, and
    in structure are remarkably like the right median or pineal eye of Ammoc&#x0153;tes; while the
    lateral eyes possess, as in the crustaceans, an upright compound retina, or, as in many of the
    arachnids, a simple inverted retina. The lateral eyes of the vertebrates alone possess a
    compound inverted retina.</p>
    <p>This retina, however, is extraordinarily similar in its structure to the compound crustacean
    retina, and these similarities are more accentuated in the retina of the lateral eye of
    Petromyzon than that of the higher vertebrates.</p>
    <p>The evidence afforded by the lateral eye of the vertebrate points unmistakably to the
    conclusion that the ancestor of the vertebrate possessed both crustacean and arachnid
    characters&mdash;belonged, therefore, to a group of animals which gave rise to both the
    crustacean and arachnid groups. This is precisely the position of the Pal√¶ostracan group, which
    is regarded as the ancestor of both the crustaceans and arachnids. <span class="pagenum"
    id="page118">{118}</span>In two respects the retina of the lateral eyes of vertebrates differs
    from that of all arthropods, for it possesses a special supporting structure, the M√ºllerian
    fibres, which do not exist in the latter, and it is developed in connection with a tube, the
    optic diverticulum, which is connected on each side with the main tube of the central nervous
    system. These two differences are in reality one and the same, for the M√ºllerian fibres are the
    altered lining cells of the optic diverticulum, and this tube has the same significance as the
    rest of the tube of the nervous system; it is something which has nothing to do with the nervous
    portion of the retina but has become closely amalgamated with it. The explanation is, word for
    word, the same as for the tubular nervous system, and shows that the ancestor of the vertebrate
    possessed two anterior diverticula of its alimentary canal which were in close relationship to
    the optic ganglion and nerve of the lateral eye on each side. It is again a striking coincidence
    to find that Artemia, which with Branchipus represents a group of living crustaceans most nearly
    allied to the trilobites, does possess two anterior diverticula of the gut which are in
    extraordinarily close relationship with the optic ganglia of the retina of the lateral eyes on
    each side.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The evidence of the optic apparatus of the vertebrate points most remarkably to
    the derivation of the Vertebrata from the Pal√¶ostraca.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The explanation of the two optic diverticula given in the last chapter accounts in the same
  harmonious manner for every other part of the tube around which the central nervous system of the
  vertebrate has been grouped. The tube conforms in all respects to the simple epithelial tube which
  formed the alimentary canal of the ancient type of marine arthropods such as were dominant in the
  seas when the vertebrates first appeared. The whole evidence so far is so uniform and points so
  strongly in the direction of the origin of vertebrates from these ancient arthropods, as to make
  it an imperative duty to proceed further and to compare one by one the other parts of the central
  nervous system, together with their outgoing nerves in the two groups of animals.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to do this, it is advisable first to consider the question of the origin of
  the vertebrate skeletal tissues, for this is the second of the great difficulties in the way of
  deriving vertebrates from arthropods, the one skeleton being an endo-skeleton composed of
  cartilage and bone, and the other an exo-skeleton composed of chitin. Here is a problem of a
  totally different kind to that we have just been considering, but of so fundamental a character
  that it must, if possible, be solved before passing on to the consideration of the cranial nerves
  and the organs they supply.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page120">{120}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">Is there any evidence which makes it possible to conceive the method by which the
  vertebrate skeleton may have arisen from the skeletal tissues of an arthropod? By the vertebrate
  skeleton I mean the bony and cartilaginous structures which form the backbone, the cranio-facial
  skeleton, the pectoral and pelvic girdles, and the bones of the limbs. I do not include the
  notochord in these skeletal tissues, because there is not the slightest evidence that the
  notochord played any part in the formation of these structures; the notochordal tissue is
  something <i>sui generis</i>, and never gives rise to cartilage or bone. The notochord happens to
  lie in the middle line of the body and is very conspicuous in the lowest vertebrate; with the
  development of the backbone the notochord becomes obliterated more and more, until at last it is
  visible in the higher vertebrates only in the embryo; but that obliteration is the result of the
  encroachment of the growing bone-masses, not the cause of their growth. Although, then, the
  notochord may in a sense be spoken of as the original supporting axial rod of the vertebrate, it
  is so different to the rest of the endo-skeleton, has so little to do with it, that the
  consideration of its origin is a thing apart, and must be treated by itself without reference to
  the origin of the cartilaginous and bony skeleton.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Commencement of the Bony Skeleton in the Vertebrate.</span></p>

  <p>What is the teaching of the vertebrate? What evidence is there as to the origin of the bony
  skeleton in the vertebrate phylum itself?</p>

  <p>The axial bony skeleton of the higher Mammalia consists of two parts, (1) the vertebral column
  with its attached bony parts, and (2) the cranio-facial skeleton. Of these two parts, the bony
  tissue of the first arises in the embryo from cartilage, of the second partly from cartilage,
  partly from membrane.</p>

  <p>In strict accordance with their embryonic origin is their phylogenetic origin: as we pass from
  the higher vertebrates to the lower these structures can be traced back to a cartilaginous and
  membranous condition, so that, as Parker has shown, the cranio-facial bony skeleton of the higher
  vertebrates can be derived directly from a non-bony cartilaginous skeleton, such as is seen in
  Petromyzon and the cartilaginous fishes.</p>

  <p>Balfour, in his "Comparative Embryology," states that the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page121">{121}</span>primitive cartilaginous cranium is always composed of the following
  parts<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. A pair of cartilaginous plates on each side of the cephalic section of the notochord known
  as the parachordals (<i>pa.ch.</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig49">49</a>; <i>iv.</i>, Fig. <a
  href="#fig48">48</a>). These plates, together with the notochord (<i>ch.</i>) enclosed between
  them, form a floor for the hind and mid-brain.</p>

  <p>2. A pair of bars forming the floor for the fore-brain, known as the trabecul√¶ (<i>tr</i>).
  These bars are continued forward from the parachordals. They meet posteriorly and embrace the
  front end of the notochord, and after separating for some distance bend in again in such a way as
  to enclose a space&mdash;the pituitary space (<i>pt.s.</i>). In <span class="pagenum"
  id="page122">{122}</span>front of this space they remain in contact, and generally unite. They
  extend forward into the nasal region (<i>pn.</i>).</p>

  <p>3. The cartilaginous capsules of the sense organs. Of these the auditory (<i>au.</i>) and the
  olfactory capsules (<i>ol.</i>) unite more or less intimately with the cranial walls; while the
  optic capsules, forming the usually cartilaginous sclerotics, remain distinct.</p>

  <p>The parachordals and notochord form together the basilar plate, which forms the floor for that
  section of the brain belonging to the primitive postoral part of the head, and its extent
  corresponds roughly to that of the basioccipital of the adult skull.</p>

  <p>The trabecul√¶, so far as their mere anatomical relations are concerned, play the same part in
  forming the floor for the front cerebral vesicle as do the parachordals for the mid- and
  hind-brain. They differ, however, from the parachordals in one important feature, viz. that except
  at their hinder end they do not embrace the notochord. The notochord always terminates at the
  infundibulum, and the trabecul√¶ always enclose a pituitary space, in which lies the infundibulum
  (<i>inf.</i>) and the pituitary body (<i>py.</i>).</p>

  <p>In the majority of the lower forms the trabecul√¶ arise quite independently of the parachordals,
  though the two sets of elements soon unite.</p>

  <p>The trabecul√¶ are usually somewhat lyre-shaped, meeting in front and behind, and leaving a
  large pituitary space between their middle parts. Into this space the whole base of the fore-brain
  primitively projects, but the space itself gradually becomes narrowed until it usually contains
  only the pituitary body.</p>

  <p>The trabecular floor of the brain does not long remain simple. Its sides grow vertically
  upwards, forming a lateral wall for the brain, in which in the higher types, two regions may be
  distinguished, viz. an alisphenoidal region behind, growing out from what is known as the
  basisphenoidal region of the primitive trabecul√¶, and an orbito-sphenoidal region in front,
  growing out from the presphenoidal region of the trabecul√¶. These plates form at first a
  continuous lateral wall of the cranium. The cartilaginous walls which grow up from the trabecular
  floor of the cranium generally extend upwards so as to form a roof, though almost always an
  imperfect roof, for the cranial cavity.</p>

  <p>The basi-cranial cartilaginous skeleton reduces itself always into trabecul√¶ and parachordals
  with olfactory and auditory cartilaginous capsules.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page123">{123}</span></div>

  <p>In addition, a branchial skeleton exists, which consists of a series of bars known as the
  branchial bars, so situated as to afford support to the successive branchial pouches. An anterior
  arch known as the mandibular arch (Fig. <a href="#fig50">50</a>, <i>Mn.</i>), placed in front of
  the hyo-mandibular cleft, and a second arch, known as the hyoid arch (<i>Hy.</i>), placed in front
  of the hyo-branchial cleft, are developed in all types; the succeeding arches are known as the
  true branchial arches (<i>Br.</i>), and are only fully developed in the Ichthyopsida. In all cases
  of jaw-bearing (gnathostomatous) vertebrates the first arch has become a supporting skeleton for
  the mouth (Fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>), and in the higher vertebrates in combination with the
  second or hyoid arch takes part in the formation of the ear-bones.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The true branchial arches persist, to a certain extent, in the Amphibia, and become still more
  degenerated in the Amniota (reptiles, birds, and mammals) in correlation with the total
  disappearance of a branchial respiration at all periods of their life. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page124">{124}</span>Their remnants become more or less important parts of the hyoid bone, and
  are employed solely in support of the tongue.</p>

  <p>In no single animal is there any evidence that the foremost arch, the mandibular, is a true
  branchial arch. As low down as the Elasmobranchs it becomes divided into two elements which form
  respectively the upper and lower jaws; the hyoid arch, on the other hand, although it has altered
  its form and acquired the secondary function of supporting the mandibular arch, still retains its
  respiratory function.</p>

  <p>The evidence afforded by the mode of formation of the skeletal tissues of vertebrates down to
  the Elasmobranchs indicates that the primitive cranial skeleton arose from two paired basal
  cartilages, the parachordals and trabecul√¶, to which were attached respectively cartilaginous
  cases enclosing the organs of hearing and smell. In addition, the branchial portion of the cranial
  region was provided with cartilaginous bars arranged serially for the support of the branchi√¶,
  with the exception of the foremost, the mandibular bar, which formed supporting tissues for the
  mouth&mdash;the upper and lower jaws.</p>

  <p>Just as in past times the spinal nerves and the segments they supplied were supposed to
  represent the type on which the original vertebrate was built, so also the spinal vertebr√¶
  afforded the type of the segmented skeleton, and the anatomists of those days strove hard to
  resolve the cranio-facial skeleton into a series of modified vertebr√¶. Owing especially to the
  labours of Huxley, who showed that the segmentation in the head-region was essentially a
  segmentation due to the presence of branchial bars, this conception was finally laid to rest and
  nowadays it is admitted to be hopeless to resolve the cranium into vertebral segments. Still,
  however, the vertebrate is a segmented animal and its segmented nature is visible in the cranial
  region, so far as the skeletal tissues are concerned, in the shape of the series of branchial and
  visceral bars.</p>

  <p>To this segmentation the name of 'branchiomeric' has been given, while that due to the presence
  of vertebr√¶ is called 'mesomeric.'</p>

  <p>As we have seen, the internal bony skeleton of the vertebrate commences as a cartilaginous and
  membranous skeleton. For this reason the preservation of such skeletons is impossible in the
  fossil form, unless the cartilage has become impregnated with lime salts, so that there is but
  little hope of ever obtaining traces of such <span class="pagenum"
  id="page125">{125}</span>structures in the fossils of the Silurian age either among the vertebrate
  or invertebrate remains. Fortunately for this investigation there are still living on the earth
  two representatives of that age; on the invertebrate side Limulus, and on the vertebrate side
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>The Elasmobranchs represent the most primitive of the gnathostomatous vertebrates. Below them
  come the Agnatha, known as the cyclostomatous fishes or Marsipobranchii, the lampreys (Petromyzon)
  and the hag-fishes (Myxine).</p>

  <p>The skeleton of Petromyzon (Fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>) consists of a cranio-facial skeleton
  composed of a cartilaginous unsegmented cranium, with the basal trabecul√¶ and parachordals and a
  series of branchial and visceral cartilaginous bars forming the so-called branchial basket-work;
  to these must be added auditory and nasal capsules. In contradistinction to this elaborate
  cranio-facial skeleton, the spinal vertebral skeleton is represented only by segmentally arranged
  small pieces of cartilage formed in the connective tissue dissepiments between segmented sheets of
  body-muscles (myotomes).</p>

  <div class="ac w40 fcenter sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But Petromyzon is derived from Ammoc&#x0153;tes by a remarkable process of transformation, and
  a most important part of that transformation is the formation of new cartilaginous structures.
  Thus we see that in Ammoc&#x0153;tes there is no sign of a cartilaginous vertebral column; at
  transformation the rudimentary vertebr√¶ of Petromyzon are formed. In Ammoc&#x0153;tes the
  brain-case is a simple fibrous membranous covering; at transformation this becomes cartilaginous.
  In Ammoc&#x0153;tes there are no cartilaginous structures corresponding to the sub-ocular arches;
  these are all formed at transformation. It follows, that we can trace back the bony skeleton of
  the vertebrate head to the skeleton of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and we may therefore conclude <span
  class="pagenum" id="page126">{126}</span>that the primitive cartilaginous skeleton of the
  vertebrate consisted of the following structures (Fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, B), viz. the
  branchial bars forming a basket-work, the trabecul√¶ and parachordals, the auditory and nasal
  capsules&mdash;a clear proof that the cranial skeleton is older than the spinal. Of these
  structures the branchial bars are the only evidently segmented parts.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Soft Cartilage of the Branchial Skeleton of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>The study of Ammoc&#x0153;tes gives yet another clue to the nature of the earliest skeleton,
  for these two marked groups of cartilage&mdash;the branchial and basi-cranial&mdash;are
  characterized by a difference in structure as well as a difference in topographical position. J.
  M√ºller was the first to point out that these two sets of cartilages differ in appearance and
  constitution, and he gave to them the name of yellow and grey cartilage. Parker has described them
  fully under the terms soft and hard cartilage, terms which Schaffer has also used, and I shall
  also make use of them here. The whole of the branchial cartilaginous skeleton is composed of soft
  cartilage, while the basi-cranial skeleton, consisting of trabecul√¶, parachordals, and auditory
  capsule, is composed <span class="pagenum" id="page127">{127}</span>of hard cartilage, the only
  soft cartilage in this region being that which forms the nasal capsule, not represented in Fig. <a
  href="#fig53">53</a>, B.</p>

  <p>These two groups of cartilage arise independently, so that at first the basi-cranial system is
  quite separate from the branchial, and only late in the history of the animal is a junction
  effected between the branchial system and the trabecul√¶ and parachordals, an initial separation
  which is especially striking when we consider that in this animal all the cartilaginous structures
  of any one system are continuous: there is no sign of anything in the nature of joints.</p>

  <p>Of these two main groups, the branchial cartilages are formed first in the embryo, a fact which
  suggests that they are the most primitive of the vertebrate cartilages, and that, therefore, the
  first true formation of cartilage in the invertebrate ancestor may be looked for in the shape of
  bars supporting the branchial mechanism. The evidence of the origin of the cartilaginous
  structures in Ammoc&#x0153;tes is given by Shipley in the following words<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The branchial bases are the first part of the skeleton to appear. They arise about the 24th
  day as straight bars of cartilage, lying external and slightly posterior to the branchial
  vessel.</p>

  <p>"The first traces of the basi-cranial skeleton appear on the 30th day as two rods of
  cartilage&mdash;the trabecul√¶."</p>

  <p>Our attention must, in the first place, be directed to this branchial basket-work of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>Underlying the skin of Ammoc&#x0153;tes in the branchial region is situated the sheet of
  longitudinal body-muscles, divided into a series of segments or myotomes, which forms the somatic
  muscles so characteristic of all fishes. This muscular sheet is depicted on the left-hand side of
  Fig. <a href="#fig54">54</a>. It does not extend over the lower lip or over that part in the
  middle line where the thyroid gland is situated. In these parts a sheet of peculiar tissue known
  by the name of muco-cartilage lies immediately under the skin, covering over the thyroid gland and
  lower lip. The somatic muscular sheet with the superjacent skin can be stripped off very easily
  owing to the vascularity and looseness of the tissue immediately underlying it. When this is done
  the branchial basket-work comes beautifully into view as is seen on the right-hand side of Fig. <a
  href="#fig54">54</a>. It forms a cage within which the branchi√¶ and their muscles lie entirely
  concealed.</p>

  <p>This is the great characteristic of this most primitive form of the branchial cartilaginous
  bars and distinguishes it from the branchial <span class="pagenum" id="page128">{128}</span>bars
  of other higher fishes, in that it forms a system of cartilages which lie external to the
  branchi√¶&mdash;an extra-branchial system.</p>

  <p>This branchial basket-work is simpler in Ammoc&#x0153;tes than in Petromyzon, and its actual
  starting-point consists of a main transverse bar corresponding to each branchial segment; from
  this transverse bar the system of longitudinal bars by which the basket-work is formed has sprung.
  These transverse bars arise from a cartilaginous longitudinal rod, situated close against the
  notochord on each side. These rods may be called the subchordal cartilaginous bands (Fig. <a
  href="#fig53">53</a>), and, according to the observations of Schneider and others, each subchordal
  band does not form at first a continuous cartilaginous rod, but the cartilage is conspicuous only
  at the places where the transverse bars arise. In the youngest Ammoc&#x0153;tes examined by
  Schaffer, he could find no absolute discontinuity of the cartilage except between the first two
  transverse bars, but he says that the thinning between the transverse bars was so marked as to
  make it highly probable that at an earlier stage there was discontinuity. The whole system of

  trabecul√¶ and parachordals, and only later do the two systems join.</p>

  </div>

  <p>These observations on Ammoc&#x0153;tes lead most definitely to the conclusion that the
  starting-point of the whole cartilaginous skeleton of the vertebrate consisted of a series of
  transverse cartilaginous bars, for the purpose of supporting branchial segments; these were
  connected with two axial longitudinal cartilaginous rods, which at first contained cartilage only
  near the places of junction of the branchial <span class="pagenum" id="page129">{129}</span>bars.
  This system may be called the mesosomatic skeleton, as it is entirely confined to the branchial or
  mesosomatic region.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In addition to this primitive cartilaginous framework, which was formed for the
  support of the mesosomatic or respiratory segments, but at a slightly later period in the
  phylogenetic history, a separate cartilaginous system was formed for the support of the prosomatic
  segments, viz. the trabecul√¶ and parachordals with the auditory capsules: a system which was at
  first entirely separated from the mesosomatic, and, as we shall see, is more advanced in structure
  than the branchial system. Later still, the story is completed at the time of transformation to
  Petromyzon by the formation of the simple cartilaginous skull and the rudimentary vertebr√¶, the
  structure of which is also of a more advanced type.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Structure of the Soft Branchial Cartilage.</span></p>

  <p>Having considered the topographical position of the primitive branchial cartilaginous skeleton,
  we may now inquire, What was its structure and how was it formed?</p>

  <p>In the higher vertebrates various forms of cartilage are described, viz. hyaline,
  fibro-cartilage, elastic cartilage, and parenchymatous cartilage. Of these, the parenchymatous
  cartilage is looked upon as the most primitive form, because it preserves without modification the
  characters of embryonic cartilage.</p>

  <p>Embryology, then, would lead to the belief that the earliest form of cartilage in the
  vertebrate kingdom ought to be of this type, viz. large cells, each of which is enclosed in a
  simple capsule, so that the capsules of the cells form the whole of the matrix, and thus form a
  simple homogeneous honeycomb-structure, in the alveoli of which the cartilage-cells lie singly.
  If, then, the branchial cartilages of Ammoc&#x0153;tes are, as has just been argued, the
  representatives of the cartilaginous skeleton of the primitive vertebrate, it is reasonable to
  suppose that they should resemble in structure this embryonic cartilage. Such is undoubtedly the
  case: all observers who have described the branchial basket-work of Ammoc&#x0153;tes or Petromyzon
  have been struck with the extremely primitive character of the cartilage, and the last observer
  (Schaffer) describes it as composed of thin walls of homogeneous material, in which there are no
  lines of separation, which form a simple honeycomb-structure, in the alveoli <span class="pagenum"
  id="page130">{130}</span>of which the separate cells lie singly. These branchial cartilages are
  each surrounded by a layer of perichondrium, and in Fig. <a href="#fig55">55</a>, A, I give a
  picture of a section of a portion of one of the bars.</p>

  <div class="ac w50 fcenter sp2">

  </div>

  <p class="sp3">Hence we see that structurally as well as topographically the branchial bars of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes justify their claim to be considered as the origin of the vertebrate
  cartilaginous framework.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">On the Structure of the Muco-cartilage in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>We can, however, go further than this, and ask how this cartilage itself is formed in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes? The answer is most definite, most instructive and suggestive, for in all cases
  this particular kind of cartilage is formed from, or at all events in, a peculiar fibrous tissue,
  which was called by Schneider "Schleim-Knorpel," or muco-cartilage, a tissue which is
  distinguishable from other connective tissues, not only by its structural peculiarities, but also
  by its strong affinity for all dyes which differentiate mucoid or chondro-mucoid substances.</p>

  <p>This muco-cartilage is thus described by Schneider:&mdash;The perichondrium in Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  is not confined to the true cartilaginous structures, but extends itself in the form of thin
  plates in definite directions. Between these plates of perichondrium a peculiar tissue (Fig. <a
  href="#fig56">56</a>)&mdash;the muco-cartilage&mdash;exists, consisting of fibrill√¶, whose
  direction is mainly at right angles to the planes of the perichondrial plates, with star-shaped
  cells in among them, and with the spaces between the fibrill√¶ filled up with a semi-fluid
  mass.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page131">{131}</span></div>

  <p>From this tissue all the primitive cartilages which resemble the branchial bars are formed,
  either by the invasion of chondroblasts from the surrounding perichondrium, or by the
  proliferation and encapsulation of the cells of the muco-cartilage itself.</p>

  <div class="ac w25 fcenter sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This very distinctive tissue&mdash;the muco-cartilage&mdash;is of very great importance in all
  questions of the origin of the skeletal tissues. In all descriptions of the skeletal tissues it
  has been practically disregarded until recent years when, besides my own observations, its
  distribution has been mapped out by Schaffer. Thus Parker, in his well-known description of the
  skeleton of the marsipobranch fishes, does not even mention its existence. Its importance is shown
  by its absolute disappearance at transformation and its non-occurrence in any of the higher
  vertebrates. It is entirely confined to the head-region, and its distribution there is most
  suggestive, for, as will be described fully later on, it forms a skeleton which both in structure
  and position resembles very closely the head-shields of cephalaspidian fishes. At the present part
  of my argument its more immediate interest lies in the method of tracing this tissue. For this
  purpose I made use of the micro-chemical reaction of thionin, a dye which, as shown by Hoyer,
  stains all mucin-containing substances a bright purple. Schaffer made use of a corresponding
  basophil stain, h√¶malum. When stained with thionin, the matrix, or ground-substance of the
  branchial cartilages as well as the matrix or semi-fluid substance in which the fibrils of the
  muco-cartilaginous cells are embedded take on a deep purple colour, while the fibrous material of
  the cranial walls and other connective tissue strands, such as the perichondrium, are coloured
  light blue. Muco-cartilage, then, may be described as a peculiar form of connective tissue which
  differs from other connective tissue not only in its appearance but in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page132">{132}</span>its chemical composition, for unlike white fibrous tissue it contains a
  large amount of mucin, and this tissue is the forerunner of the earliest cartilaginous vertebrate
  skeleton, the branchial bars of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>The conclusions to which we are led by the study of the structure, position, and mode of origin
  of these primitive cartilages of Ammoc&#x0153;tes may be thus summed up<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1.  The immediate ancestor of the vertebrate must have possessed a peculiar fibrous
  tissue&mdash;the ground-substance of which stained deep purple with thionin&mdash;in which
  cartilage arose.</p>

  <p>2.  The cartilage so formed was not like hyaline cartilage, but resembled in a striking manner
  parenchymatous cartilage.</p>

  <p class="sp3">3.  This cartilage was situated partly in two axial longitudinal bands, partly as
  transverse bars, which supported the branchial apparatus.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Prosomatic or Basi-cranial Skeleton of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>Before searching for any evidence of a similar tissue in any invertebrate group, it is
  advisable to consider the other portion of the cartilaginous skeleton of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, which
  consists of the trabecul√¶, parachordals and auditory capsules&mdash;the basi-cranial
  skeleton&mdash;and is composed of hard, not soft cartilage.</p>

  <p>This basi-cranial skeleton represented in Fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, B, is confined to the
  region of the notochord, the cranial walls being composed entirely of a white fibrous membrane. It
  is separated at first entirely from the sub-chordal portion of the branchial basket-work, and is
  composed of a foremost part, the trabecul√¶ (<i>Tr.</i>), and of a hindermost part, the
  parachordals (<i>Pr.ch.</i>), which are characterized by the attachment on each side of the large
  auditory capsule (<i>Au.</i>). In Ammoc&#x0153;tes the trabecular bars are continuous with the
  parachordals, the junction being marked by a small lateral projection on each side, which at
  transformation is seen to play an important part in the formation of the sub-ocular arch. The
  trabecular bar lies close against the notochord on each side up to its termination; it then bends
  away from the middle line and curves round until it meets its fellow on the opposite side, thus
  forming, as it were, the head of a racquet of which the notochord forms the splice in the handle.
  The strings of the racquet are represented by a thin membrane, in the centre of which the position
  of the infundibulum (<i>Inf.</i>) of the <span class="pagenum" id="page133">{133}</span>brain can
  be clearly seen. In an earlier stage of Ammoc&#x0153;tes the two trabecular horns do not meet, but
  are separated by connective tissue, which afterwards becomes cartilaginous.</p>

  <p>As far, then, as the topography of this basi-cranial skeleton is concerned, the striking points
  are&mdash;the shape of the trabecular portion, diverging as it does around the infundibulum, and
  the presence on the parachordal portion of the two large auditory capsules.</p>

  <p>These two points indicate, on the hypothesis that infundibulum and &#x0153;sophagus are
  convertible terms, that two supporting structures of a cartilaginous nature must have existed in
  the ancestor of the vertebrate, the first of which surrounded the &#x0153;sophagus, and the second
  was in connection with its auditory apparatus.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Structure of the Hard Cartilages.</span></p>

  <p>The structure of this hard cartilage of the trabecul√¶ and auditory capsules resembles that of
  the soft, in so far that it consists of large cells with a comparatively small amount of
  intercellular substance. Schaffer, who has described it lately, considers that it is a nearer
  approach to hyaline cartilage than the soft, but yet cannot be called hyaline cartilage in the
  usual sense of the term. Its peculiarities and its differences from the soft are especially well
  seen by its staining reactions. I have myself been particularly struck with the effect of
  picrocarmine or combined h√¶matoxylin and picric acid <span class="pagenum"
  id="page134">{134}</span>staining (Fig. <a href="#fig57">57</a>). In the case of the soft
  cartilage the capsular substance stains respectively a brilliant red or blue, while that of the
  hard cartilage is coloured a deep yellow, so that the junction between the parachordals and the
  branchial cartilages is beautifully marked out. Then, again, with thionin, which gives so marked a
  reaction in the case of the soft cartilage, the hard cartilage of the auditory capsule is not
  stained at all, and in the trabecul√¶ the deep purple colour is confined to the mucoid
  cement-substance between the capsules, just as Schaffer has stated. The same kinds of reactions
  have been described by Schaffer: thus by double staining with h√¶malum-eosin the hard cartilage
  stains red, the soft blue; and he points out that even with over-staining by h√¶malum the auditory
  capsule remains colourless, just as I have noticed with thionin. He infers, precisely as I have
  done from the thionin reaction, that chondro-mucoid, which is so marked a constituent of the soft
  cartilage and of the muco-cartilage, is absent or present in but slight quantities in the hard
  cartilage. Similarly, he points out that double staining with trop&#x0153;olin-methyl-violet
  stains the hard cartilage a bright orange colour, and the soft cartilage a violet.</p>

  <p>The evidence, then, shows clearly that a marked chemical difference exists between these two
  cartilages, which may be expressed by saying that the one contains very largely a basophil
  substance, which we may speak of as belonging to the class of chondro-mucoid substances, while the
  other contains mainly an oxyphil substance, probably a chondro-gelatine substance.</p>

  <p>We may perhaps go further and attribute this difference of composition to a difference of
  origin; for whereas the soft cartilage is invariably formed in a special tissue, the
  muco-cartilage, which shows by its reaction how largely it is composed of a mucoid substance, the
  hard cartilage is certainly, in the case of the cartilage of the cranium where its origin has been
  clearly made out, formed in the membranous tissue of the cranium of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in a tissue which stains light blue with thionin, and contains
  a gelatinous rather than a mucoid substratum.</p>

  <p>The best opportunity of finding out the mode of origin of the hard cartilage is afforded at the
  time of transformation, when so much of this kind of cartilage is formed anew. Unfortunately, it
  is very difficult to obtain the early transformation stages, consequently we cannot be said to
  possess any really exhaustive and <span class="pagenum" id="page135">{135}</span>definite account
  of how the new cartilages are formed. Bujor, Kaensche, and Schaffer all profess to give a more or
  less definite account of their formation, and the one striking impression left on the mind of the
  reader is how their descriptions vary. In one point only are they agreed, and in that I also agree
  with them, viz. the manner in which the new cranial walls are formed. Schaffer describes the
  process as the invasion of chondroblasts into the homogeneous fibrous tissue of the cranial walls.
  Such chondroblasts not only form the cartilaginous framework, but also assimilate the fibrous
  tissue which they invade, so that finally all that remains of the original fibrous matrix in which
  the cartilage was formed are these lines of cement-substance between the groups of cartilage
  cells, which, containing some basophil material, are marked out, as already mentioned (Fig. <a
  href="#fig57">57</a>).</p>

  <p>We may therefore conclude, from the investigation of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, that the front part of
  the basi-cranial skeleton arose as two trabecular bars, to which muscles were attached, situated
  bilaterally with respect to the central nervous system. These bars were composed of tendinous
  material with a gelatinous rather than a mucoid substratum, in which nests of cartilage-cells were
  formed, the cartilaginous material formed by these cells being of the hard variety, not staining
  with thionin, and staining yellow with picro-carmine, etc. By the increase of such nests and the
  assimilation of the intermediate fibrous material, the original fibro-cartilage was converted into
  the close-set semi-hyaline cartilage of the trabecul√¶ and auditory capsules, in which the fibrous
  material still marks out by its staining-reaction the limits of the cell-clusters.</p>

  <p>Such I gather to be Schaffer's conclusions, and they are certainly borne out by my own and Miss
  Alcock's observations. As far as we have had an opportunity of observing at present, the first
  process at transformation appears to consist of the invasion of the fibrous tissue of the cranial
  wall by groups of cells which form nests of cells between the fibrous strands. These nests of
  cells form round themselves capsular material, and thus form cell-territories of cartilage, which
  squeeze out and assimilate the surrounding fibrous tissue, until at last all that remains of the
  original fibrous matrix is the lines of cement-substance which mark out the limits of the various
  cell-groups.</p>

  <p>At present I am inclined to think that both soft and hard cartilage originate in a very similar
  manner, viz. by the formation of capsular <span class="pagenum" id="page136">{136}</span>material
  around the invading chondroblasts, and that the difference in the resulting cartilage is mainly
  due to the difference in chemical composition of the matrix of the connective tissue which is
  invaded. Thus the difference may be formulated as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The hard cartilage is formed by the invasion of chondroblasts into a fibrous tissue, which
  contains a gelatinous rather than a mucoid substratum, in contradistinction to the soft cartilage
  which is formed, probably also by the invasion of chondroblasts, in a tissue&mdash;the
  muco-cartilage&mdash;which contains a specially mucoid substratum.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Such, then, is the very clearly defined starting-point of the vertebrate
  skeleton&mdash;two distinct formations of different histological and chemical structure,&mdash;the
  one forming a segmented branchial skeleton, the other a non-segmented basi-cranial skeleton.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Cartilaginous Skeleton of Limulus.</span></p>

  <p>Among the whole of the invertebrates at present living on the earth, is there any sign of an
  internal cartilaginous skeleton that will give a direct clue to the origin of the primitive
  vertebrate skeleton? The answer to this question is most significant: only one animal among all
  those at present known possesses a cartilaginous skeleton, which is directly comparable with that
  of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and here the comparison is very close&mdash;only one animal among the
  thousands of living invertebrate forms, and that animal is the only representative still surviving
  of the pal√¶ostracan group, which was the dominant race when the vertebrate first made its
  appearance. The Limulus, or king-crab, possesses a segmented branchial internal cartilaginous
  skeleton (Fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, A), made up of the same kind of cartilage as the branchial
  skeleton of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, confined to the mesosomatic or branchial region, just as in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, forming, as in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, cartilaginous bars supporting the branchi√¶, and
  these bars are situated externally to the branchi√¶, as in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. In addition this
  animal possesses a basi-cranial internal semi-cartilaginous unsegmented plate known as the
  entosternite or plastron situated, with respect to the &#x0153;sophagus, similarly to the position
  of the trabecul√¶ with respect to the infundibulum in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. Moreover, the cartilaginous
  cells in this tissue differ from those in the branchial region, in precisely the same manner as
  the hard cartilage differs from the soft in Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page137">{137}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">This plastron, it is true, is found in other animals, all of which are members of
  the scorpion tribe, except in one instance, and this, strikingly enough, is the crustacean
  Apus&mdash;a strange primitive form, which is acknowledged to be the nearest representative of the
  Trilobita still living on the earth. None of these forms, however, possess any sign of an internal
  cartilaginous branchial skeleton, such as is possessed by Limulus. Scorpions, Apus, Limulus, are
  all surviving types of the stage of organization which had been reached in the animal world when
  the vertebrate first appeared.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Mesosomatic or Respiratory Skeleton of Limulus, composed of
  Soft Cartilage.</span></p>

  <p>Searching through the literature of the histology of the cartilaginous tissues in invertebrate
  animals, to see whether any cartilage had been described similar to that seen in the branchial
  cartilages of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and whether such cartilage, if found, arose in a fibrous tissue
  resembling muco-cartilage, I was speedily rewarded by finding, in Ray Lankester's article on the
  tropho-skeletal tissues of Limulus, a picture of the cartilage of Limulus, which would have passed
  muster for a drawing of the branchial cartilage of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. This clue I followed out in
  the manner described in my former paper in the <i>Journal of Anatomy and Physiology</i>, and
  mapped out the topography of this remarkable tissue.</p>

  <p>Limulus, like other water-dwelling arthropods, breathes by means of gills attached to its
  appendages. These gill-bearing appendages are confined to the mesosomatic region, as is seen in
  Fig. <a href="#fig59">59</a>; and these appendages are very different to the ordinary locomotor
  appendages, which are confined to the prosomatic region. Each appendage, as is seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig58">58</a>, consists mainly of a broad, basal part, which carries the gill-book on its
  under surface; the distal parts of the appendage have dwindled to mere rudiments and still exist,
  not for locomotor purposes, but because they carry on each segment organs of special importance to
  the animal (see Chapter XI.). As is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>, the basal parts of each
  pair of appendages form a broad, flattened paddle, by means of which the animal is able to swim in
  a clumsy fashion. Very striking and suggestive is the difference between these gill-bearing
  mesosomatic appendages and the non-gill-bearing locomotor appendages of the prosoma.</p>

      <i>Vp.</i>, veno-pericardial muscle.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>At the base of each of these appendages, where it is attached to the body of the animal, the
  external chitinous surface is characterized by a peculiar stumpy, rod-like marking, and upon
  removing the chitinous covering, this surface-appearance is seen to correspond to a well-marked
  rod of cartilage (<i>Br.C.</i>), which extends from the body <span class="pagenum"
  id="page139">{139}</span>of the animal well into each appendage. This bar of cartilage arises on
  each side from the corresponding entapophysis (<i>Ent.</i>), which is the name given to a
  chitinous spur which projects a short distance (Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>, B) into the animal
  from the dorsal side, for the purpose of giving attachment to various segmental muscles. These
  entapophyses are formed by an invagination of the chitinous surface on the dorsal side and are
  confined to the mesosomatic region, so that the mesosomatic carapace indicates, by the number of
  entapophyses, the number of segments in that region, in contradistinction to the prosomatic
  carapace, which gives no indication on its surface of the number of its components.</p>

  <p>Each entapophysis is hollow and its walls are composed of chitin; but from the apex of each
  spur there stretches from spur to spur a band of tissue, called by Lankester the entapophysial
  ligament (<i>Ent.l.</i>) (Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>), and in this tissue cartilage is formed.
  Isolated cartilaginous cells, or rather groups of cells, are found here and there, but a
  concentration of such groups always takes place at each entapophysis, forming here a solid mass of
  cartilage, from which the massive cartilaginous bar of each branchial appendage arises.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Further, not only is this cartilage exactly similar to parenchymatous cartilage, as
  it occurs in the branchial cartilages of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, but also its matrix stains a brilliant
  purple with thionin in striking contrast to the exceedingly slight light-blue colour of the
  surrounding perichondrium. In its chemical composition it shows, as might be expected, that it is
  a cartilage containing a very large amount of some mucin-body.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Muco-cartilage of Limulus.</span></p>

  <p>The resemblance between this structure and that of the branchial bars of Ammoc&#x0153;tes does
  not end even here, for, as already mentioned, the cartilage originates in a peculiar connective
  tissue band, the entapophysial ligament, and this tissue bears the same relation in its chemical
  reactions to the ordinary connective tissue of Limulus, as muco-cartilage does to the white
  fibrous tissue of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. The white connective tissue of Limulus, as already stated,
  resembles that of the vertebrate more than does the connective tissue of any other invertebrate,
  and, similarly to that of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, does not stain, or gives only a light-blue tinge with
  thionin. The tissue of <span class="pagenum" id="page140">{140}</span>the entapophysial ligament,
  on the contrary, just like muco-cartilage, takes on an intense purple colour when stained with
  thionin. It possesses a mucoid substratum, just as does muco-cartilage, and in both cases a
  perfectly similar soft cartilage is born from it.</p>

  <p>One difference, however, exists between the branchial cartilages of these two animals; the
  innermost axial layer of the branchial bar of Limulus is very apt to contain a specially hard
  substance, apparently chalky in nature, so that it breaks up in sections, and gives the appearance
  of a broken-down spongy mass; if, however, the tissue is first placed in a solution of
  hydrochloric acid, it then cuts easily, and the whole tissue is seen to be of the same structure
  throughout, the main difference being that the capsular spaces in the axial region are much larger
  and much more free from cell-protoplasm than are those of the smaller younger cells near the
  periphery.</p>

  the segmented branchial skeleton of Limulus and of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, a resemblance so close as to
  reach even to minute details, such as the thinning out of the cartilage in the subchordal bands
  and entapophysial ligaments respectively between the places where the branchial bars come off.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Prosomatic Skeleton of Limulus, composed of Hard
  Cartilage.</span></p>

  <p>The rest of the primitive vertebrate skeleton arose in the prosomatic region, and formed a
  support for the base of the brain. This skeleton was composed of hard cartilage, and arose in
  white fibrous tissue containing gelatin rather than mucin.</p>

  <p>Is there, then, any peculiar tissue of a cartilaginous nature in Limulus and its allies,
  situated in the prosomatic region, which is entirely separate from the branchial cartilaginous
  skeleton, which acts as a supporting internal framework, and contains a gelatinous rather than a
  mucoid substratum?</p>

  <p>It is a striking fact, common to the whole of the group of animals to which our inquiries,
  deduced from the consideration of the structure of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, have, in every case, led us
  in our search for the vertebrate ancestor, that they do possess a remarkable internal
  semi-cartilaginous skeleton in the prosomatic region, called the entosternite or plastron, which
  gives support to a large number of the muscles of that region; which is entirely independent of
  the branchial skeleton, and differs markedly in its chemical reactions from that cartilage, in
  that it contains a gelatinous rather than a mucoid substratum.</p>

  <p>In Limulus it is a large, tough, median plate, fibrous in character, in which are situated rows
  and nests of cartilage-cells. The same structure is seen in the plastron of Hypoctonus, of
  Thelyphonus, and to a certainty in all the members of the scorpion group. Very different is the
  behaviour of this tissue to staining from that of the branchial region. No part of the plastron
  stains purple with thionin; it hardly stains at all, or gives only a very slight blue colour. In
  its chemical composition there is a marked preponderance of gelatin with only a slight amount of a
  mucin-body. In some cases, as in Hypoctonus (Fig. <a href="#fig57">57</a>, B) and Mygale, the
  capsules of the cartilage-cells stain a deep yellow with h√¶matoxylin and picric acid, while the
  fibres between the cell-nests stain a blue-brown colour, partly from the h√¶matoxylin, partly from
  the picric acid.</p>

  <p>All the evidence points to the plastron as resembling the basi-cranial skeleton of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes in its composition and in the origin <span class="pagenum"
  id="page143">{143}</span>of its cells in a white fibrous tissue. What, then, is its topographical
  position? It is in all cases a median structure lying between the cephalic stomach and the
  infra-&#x0153;sophageal portion of the central nervous system, and in all cases it possesses two
  anterior horns which pass around the &#x0153;sophagus and the nerve-masses which immediately
  enclose the &#x0153;sophagus (Fig. <a href="#fig61">61</a>, A). These lateral horns, then, which
  lie laterally and slightly ventral to the central nervous system, and are called by Ray Lankester
  and Benham the sub-neural portion of the entosternite, are very nearly in exactly the position of
  the racquet-shaped head of the trabecul√¶ in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. It is easy to see that, with a more
  extensive growth of the nervous material dorsally, such lateral horns might be caused to take up a
  still more ventral position. Now, these two lateral horns of the plastron of Limulus are continued
  along its whole length so as to form two thickened lateral ridges, which are conspicuous on the
  flat surface of the rest of this median plate. In other cases, as in the Thelyphonid√¶, the
  plastron consists mainly of these two lateral ridges or trabecul√¶, as they might be called, and
  Schimk√©witsch, who more than any one else has made a comparative study of the entosternite,
  describes it as composed in these animals of two lateral trabecul√¶ crossed by three transverse
  trabecul√¶. I myself can confirm his description, and give in Fig. <a href="#fig61">61</a>, B, the
  appearance of the entosternite of Thelyphonus or of Hypoctonus. The supra-&#x0153;sophageal
  ganglia and part of the infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia fill up the space <i>Ph.</i>; stretching
  over the rest of the infra-&#x0153;sophageal mass is a transverse trabecula, which is very thin;
  then comes a space in which is seen the rest of the infra-&#x0153;sophageal mass, and then the
  posterior part of the plastron, ventrally to which lies the commencement of the ventral
  nerve-cord.</p>

  <p>In these forms, in which the central nervous system is more concentrated towards the cephalic
  end than in Limulus, the whole of the concentrated brain-mass is separated from the gut only by
  this thin transverse band of tissue. Judging, then, from the entosternite of Thelyphonus, it is
  not difficult to suppose that a continuation of the same growth of the brain-region of the central
  nervous system would cause the entosternite to be separated into two lateral trabecul√¶, which
  would then take up the ventro-lateral position of the two trabecul√¶ of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it might be that two lateral trabecul√¶, similar to those of Thelyphonus and
  situated on each side of the central nervous system, were the original form from which, by the
  addition of transverse fibres running between the gut and nervous system, the entosternite of
  Thelyphonus and of the scorpions, etc., was formed. From an extensive consideration of the
  entosternite in different animals, Schimk√©witsch has come to the conclusion that this latter
  explanation is the true one. He points out that the lateral trabecul√¶ can be distinguished from
  the transverse by their structure, being much more cellular and less fibrous, and the
  cell-cavities more rounded, or, as I should express it, the two lateral trabecul√¶ are more
  cartilaginous, while the transverse are more fibrous. Schimk√©witsch, from observations of
  structure and from embryological investigations, comes to the conclusion that the entosternite was
  originally composed of two parts&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. A transverse muscle corresponding to the adductor muscle of the shell of certain
  crustaceans, such as Nebalia.</p>

  <p>2. A pair of longitudinal mesodermic tendons, which may have been formed originally out of a
  number of segmentally arranged mesodermic tendons, and are crossed by the fibrils of the
  transverse muscular bundles.</p>

  <p>These paired tendons of the entosternite he considers to correspond to the intermuscular
  tendons, situated lengthways, which are found in the ventral longitudinal muscles of most
  arthropods.</p>

  <p>It is clear from these observations of Schimk√©witsch, that the essential part of the
  entosternite consists of two lateral trabecul√¶, which were originally tendinous in nature and have
  become of the nature of cartilaginous tissue by the increase of cellular elements in the matrix of
  the tissue: these two trabecul√¶ function as supports for the attachment of muscles, which are
  specially attached at certain places. At these places transverse fibres belonging to some <span
  class="pagenum" id="page145">{145}</span>of the muscular attachments cross between the two
  longitudinal trabecul√¶, and so form the transverse trabecul√¶.</p>

  <p>I entirely agree with Schimk√©witsch that the nests of cartilage-cells are much more extensive
  in, and indeed nearly entirely confined to, these two lateral trabecul√¶ in the entosternite of
  Hypoctonus. Ray Lankester describes in the entosternite of Mygale peculiar cell-nests strongly
  resembling those of Hypoctonus, and he also states that they are confined to the lateral portions
  of the entosternite.</p>

  <p>From this evidence it is easy to see that that portion of the basi-cranial skeleton known as
  the trabecul√¶ may have originated from the formation of cartilage in the plastron or entosternite
  of a pal√¶ostracan animal. Such an hypothesis immediately suggests valuable clues as to the origin
  of the cranium and of the rest of the basi-cranial skeleton&mdash;the parachordals and the
  auditory capsules. The former would naturally be a dorsal extension of the more membranous portion
  of the plastron, in which, equally naturally, cartilaginous tissue would subsequently develop; and
  the reason why it is impossible to reduce the cranium into a series of segments would be
  self-evident, for even though, as Schimk√©witsch thinks, the plastron may have been originally
  segmented, it has long lost all sign of segmentation. The latter would be derived from a second
  entosternite of the same nature as the plastron, but especially connected with the auditory
  apparatus of the invertebrate ancestor. The following out of these two clues will be the subject
  of a future chapter.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In our search, then, for a clue to the origin of the skeletal tissues of the
  vertebrate we see again that we are led directly to the pal√¶ostracan stock on the invertebrate
  side and to the Cyclostomata on that of the vertebrate; for in Limulus, the only living
  representative of the Pal√¶ostraca, and in Limulus alone, we find a skeleton marvellously similar
  to the earliest vertebrate skeleton&mdash;that found in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. Later on I shall give
  reasons for the belief that the earliest fishes so far found, the Cephalaspid√¶, etc., were built
  up on the same plan as Ammoc&#x0153;tes, so that, in my opinion, in Limulus and in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes we actually possess living examples allied to the ancient fauna of the Silurian
  times.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp2">
    <p>The skeleton considered in this chapter is not the notochord, but that composed of cartilage.
    The tracing downwards of the vertebrate bony and cartilaginous skeleton to its earliest
    beginnings leads straight to the skeleton of the larval lamprey (Ammoc&#x0153;tes), in which
    vertebr√¶ are not yet formed, but the cranial and branchial skeleton is well marked.</p>
    <p>The embryological and phylogenetic histories are in complete unison to show that the cranial
    skeleton is older than the spinal, and this primitive branchial skeleton is also in harmony with
    the laws of evolution, in that its structure, even in the adult lamprey (Petromyzon), never gets
    beyond the stage characteristic of embryonic cartilage in the higher vertebrates.</p>
    <p>The simplest and most primitive skeleton is that found in Ammoc&#x0153;tes and consists of
    two parts: (1) a prosomatic, (2) a mesosomatic skeleton.</p>
    <p>The prosomatic skeleton forms a non-segmented basi-cranial skeleton of the simplest
    kind&mdash;the trabecul√¶ and the parachordals with their attached auditory capsules, just as the
    embryology of the higher vertebrates teaches us must be the case. There in the free-living,
    still-existent Ammoc&#x0153;tes we find the manifest natural outcome of the embryological
    history in the shape of simple trabecul√¶ and parachordals, from which the whole complicated
    basi-cranial skeleton of the higher vertebrates arose.</p>
    <p>The mesosomatic skeleton, which is formed before the prosomatic, consisted, in the first
    instance, of simple branchial bars segmentally arranged, which were connected together by a
    longitudinal subchordal bar, situated laterally on each side of the notochord. These simple
    branchial bars later on form the branchial basket-work, which forms an open-work cage within
    which the branchi√¶ are situated.</p>
    <p>The cartilages which compose these two skeletons respectively are markedly different in
    chemical constitution, in that the first (hard cartilage) is mainly composed of chondro-gelatin,
    the second (soft cartilage) of chondro-mucoid material.</p>
    <p>The same kind of difference is seen in the two kinds of connective tissue which are the
    forerunners of these two kinds of cartilage. Thus, the cranial walls in Ammoc&#x0153;tes are
    formed of white fibrous tissue, an essentially gelatin-containing tissue; at transformation
    these are invaded by chondro-blasts and the cartilaginous cranium, formed of hard cartilage,
    results. On the other hand, the forerunner of the branchial soft cartilage is a very striking
    and peculiar kind of connective tissue loaded with mucoid material, to which the name
    muco-cartilage has been given.</p>
    <p>The enormous interest of this muco-cartilage consists in the fact that it forms very
    well-defined plates of tissue, entirely confined to the head-region, which are not found in any
    higher vertebrate, not even in the adult form Petromyzon, for every scrap of the tissue as such
    disappears at transformation.</p>
    <p>It is this evidence of primitive non-vertebrate tissues, which occur in the larval but not in
    the adult form, which makes Ammoc&#x0153;tes so valuable for the investigation of the origin of
    vertebrates.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The evidence, then, is extraordinarily clear as to the beginnings of the
    vertebrate skeletal tissues.</p>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page147">{147}</span></div>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>In the invertebrate kingdom true cartilage occurs but scantily. There is a cartilaginous
    covering of the brain of cephalopods. It is never found in crabs, lobsters, bees, wasps,
    centipedes, butterflies, flies, or any of the great group of Arthropoda, except, to a slight
    extent, in some members of the scorpion group, and more fully in one single animal, the
    King-crab or Limulus: a fact significant of itself, but still more so when the nature of the
    cartilage and its position in the animal is taken into consideration, for the identity both in
    structure and position of this internal cartilaginous skeleton with that of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is
    extraordinarily great.</p>
    <p>Here, in Limulus, just as in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, an internal cartilaginous skeleton is found,
    composed of two distinct parts: (1) prosomatic, (2) mesosomatic. As in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the
    latter consists of simple branchial bars, segmentally arranged, which are connected together on
    each side by a longitudinal ligament containing cartilage&mdash;the entapophysial ligament. This
    cartilage is identical in structure and in chemical composition with the soft cartilage of
    Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and, as in the latter case, arises in a markedly mucoid connective tissue. The
    former, as in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, consists of a non-segmental skeleton, the plastron, composed of
    a white fibrous connective tissue matrix, an essentially gelatin-containing tissue, in which are
    found nests of cartilage cells of the hard cartilage variety.</p>
    <p>This remarkable discovery of the branchial cartilaginous bars of Limulus, together with that
    of the internal prosomatic plastron, causes the original difficulty of deriving an animal such
    as the vertebrate from an animal resembling an arthropod to vanish into thin air, for it shows
    that in the past ages when the vertebrates first appeared on the earth, the dominant arthropod
    race at that time, the members of which resembled Limulus, had solved the question; for, in
    addition to their external chitinous covering, they had manufactured an internal cartilaginous
    skeleton. Not only so, but that skeleton had arrived, both in structure and position, exactly at
    the stage at which the vertebrate skeleton starts.</p>
    <p>What the precise steps are by which chitin-formation gives place to chondrin-formation are
    not yet fully known, but Schmiedeberg has shown that a substance, glycosamine, is derivable from
    both these skeletal tissues, and he concludes his observations in the following words: "Thus, by
    means of glycosamine, the bridge is formed which connects together the chitin of the lower
    animals with the cartilage of the more highly organized creations."</p>
    <p class="sp0">The evidence of the origin of the cartilaginous skeleton of the vertebrate points
    directly to the origin of the vertebrate from the Pal√¶ostraca, and is of so strong a character
    that, taken alone, it may almost be considered as proof of such origin.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The respiratory apparatus in all the terrestrial vertebrates is of the same kind&mdash;one
  single pair of lungs. These lungs originate as a diverticulum of the alimentary canal. On the
  other hand, the aquatic vertebrates breathe by means of a series of branchi√¶, or gills, which are
  arranged segmentally, being supported by the segmental branchial cartilaginous bars, as already
  mentioned in the last chapter.</p>

  <p>The transition from the gill-bearing to the lung-bearing vertebrates is most interesting, for
  it has been proved that the lungs are formed by the modification of the swim-bladder of fishes;
  and in a group of fishes, the Dipnoi, or lung-fishes, of which three representatives still exist
  on the earth, the mode of transition from the fish to the amphibian is plainly visible, for they
  possess both lungs and gills, and yet are not amphibians, but true fishes. But for the fortunate
  existence of Ceratodus in Australia, Lepidosiren in South America, and Protopterus in Africa, it
  would have been impossible from the fossil remains to have asserted that any fish had ever existed
  which possessed at the same moment of time the two kinds of respiratory organs, although from our
  knowledge of the development of the amphibian we might have felt sure that such a transitional
  stage must have existed. Unfortunately, there is at present no likelihood of any corresponding
  transitional stage being discovered <span class="pagenum" id="page149">{149}</span>living on the
  earth in which both the dorsal arthropod alimentary canal and the ventral vertebrate one should
  simultaneously exist in a functional condition; still it seems to me that even if Ceratodus,
  Lepidosiren, and Protopterus had ceased to exist on the earth, yet the facts of comparative
  anatomy, together with our conception of evolution as portrayed in the theory of natural
  selection, would have forced us to conclude rightly that the amphibian stage in the evolution of
  the vertebrate phylum was preceded by fishes which possessed simultaneously lungs and gills.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the preceding chapter the primitive cartilaginous vertebrate skeleton, as found
  in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, was shown to correspond in a marvellous manner to the cartilaginous skeleton
  of Limulus. In a later chapter I will deal with the formation of the cranium from the prosomatic
  skeleton; in this chapter it is the mesosomatic skeleton which is of interest, and the
  consideration of the necessary consequences which logically follow upon the supposition that the
  branchial cartilaginous bars of Limulus are homologous with the branchial basket-work of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Internal Branchial Appendages.</span></p>

  <p>Seeing that in both cases the cartilaginous bars of Limulus and Ammoc&#x0153;tes are confined
  to the branchial region, their homology of necessity implies an homology of the two branchial
  regions, and leads directly to the conclusion that the branchi√¶ of the vertebrate were derived
  from the branchi√¶ of the arthropod, a conclusion which, according to the generally accepted view
  of the origin of the respiratory region in the vertebrate, is extremely difficult to accept; for
  the branchi√¶ of Limulus and of the Arthropoda in general are part of the mesosomatic appendages,
  while the branchi√¶ of vertebrates are derived from the anterior part of the alimentary canal. This
  conclusion, therefore, implies that the vertebrate has utilized in the formation of the anterior
  portion of its new alimentary canal the branchial appendages of the pal√¶ostracan ancestor.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page150">{150}</span></div>

  <div class="ac w40 fcenter sp2">

      The opercular appendage is marked out by dots.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Let us consider dispassionately whether such a suggestion is <i>a priori</i> so impossible as
  it at first appears. One of the principles of evolution is that any change which is supposed to
  have taken place in the process of formation of one animal or group of animals from a lower group
  must be in harmony with changes which are known to have occurred in that lower group. On the
  assumption, therefore, that the vertebrate branchi√¶ represent the branchial portion of the
  arthropod mesosomatic appendages which have sunk in and so become internal, we ought to find that
  in members of this very group such inclusion of branchial appendages has taken place. This,
  indeed, is exactly what we do find, for in all the scorpion tribe, which is acknowledged to be
  closely related to Limulus, there are no external mesosomatic appendages, but in all cases these
  appendages have sunk into the body, have disappeared as such, and retained only the vital part of
  them&mdash;the branchi√¶. In this way the so-called lung-books of the scorpion are formed, which
  are in all respects homologous with the branchi√¶ or gill-books of Limulus. Now, as already
  mentioned, the lords of creation in the pal√¶ostracan times were the sea-scorpions, which, as is
  seen in Fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a>, resembled the land-scorpions of the present day in the
  entire absence of any external appendages on the segments of the mesosomatic region. As they lived
  in the sea, they must have breathed with gills, and those branchial appendages must have been
  internal, just as in the land-scorpions of the present time. Indeed, markings have been found on
  the internal side of the segments 1-5, Fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a>, which are supposed to
  indicate branchi√¶, and these segments are therefore supposed to have borne the branchi√¶. Up to the
  present time no indication of gill-slits has been found, and we cannot say with certainty how
  these animals breathed. Further, in the Upper Silurian of Lesmahago, Lanarkshire, a scorpion
  (<i>Pal√¶ophonus Hunteri</i>), closely resembling the modern scorpion, has been found, which, as
  Lankester states, was in all probability aquatic, and not terrestrial in its habits. How it <span
  class="pagenum" id="page151">{151}</span>breathed is unknown; it shows no signs of stigmata, such
  as exist in the scorpion of to-day.</p>

  <p>Although we possess as yet no certain knowledge of the position of the gill-openings in these
  ancient scorpion-like forms, what we can say with certainty&mdash;and that is the important
  fact&mdash;is, that at the time when the vertebrates appeared, a very large number of the dominant
  arthropod race possessed internally-situated branchi√¶, which had been directly derived from the
  branchi√¶-bearing appendages of their Limulus-like kinsfolk.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This abolition of the branchi√¶-bearing appendages as external organs of locomotion,
  with the retention of the important branchial portion of the appendage as internal branchi√¶, is a
  very important suggestion in any discussion of the way vertebrates have arisen from arthropods;
  for, if the same principle is of universal application, it leads directly to the conclusion that
  whenever an appendage possesses an organ of vital importance to the animal, that organ will
  remain, even though the appendage as such completely vanishes. Thus, as will be shown later,
  special sense-organs such as the olfactory remain, though the animal no longer possesses antenn√¶;
  the important excretory organs, the coxal glands, and important respiratory organs, the branchi√¶,
  are still present in the vertebrate, although the appendages to which they originally belonged
  have dwindled away, or, at all events, are no longer recognizable as arthropod appendages.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Innervation of Branchial Segments.</span></p>

  <p>Passing from <i>a priori</i> considerations to actual facts, it is advisable to commence with
  the innervation of the branchial segments; for, seeing that the foundation of the whole of this
  comparative study of the vertebrate and the arthropod is based upon the similarity of the two
  central nervous systems, it follows that we must look in the first instance to the innervation of
  any organ or group of organs in order to find out their relationship in the two groups of
  animals.</p>

  <p>The great characteristic of the vertebrate branchial organs is their segmental arrangement and
  their innervation by the vagus group of nerves, <i>i.e.</i> by the hindermost group of the cranial
  segmental nerves. These cranial nerves are divided by Gegenbaur into two great groups&mdash;an
  anterior group, the trigeminal, which supplies the muscles of mastication, and a posterior group,
  the vagus, which is essentially <span class="pagenum" id="page152">{152}</span>respiratory in
  function. Of these two groups, I will consider the latter group first.</p>

  <p>In Limulus the great characteristic of the branchial region is its pronounced segmental
  arrangement, each pair of branchial appendages belonging to a separate segment. This group of
  segments forms the mesosoma, and these branchial appendages are the mesosomatic appendages.
  Anterior to them are the segments of the prosoma, which bear the prosomatic or locomotor
  appendages. The latter are provided at their base with gnathites or masticating apparatus, so that
  the prosomatic group of nerves, like the trigeminal group in the vertebrate, comprises essentially
  the nerves subserving the important function of mastication. As already pointed out, the
  brain-region of the vertebrate is comparable to the supra-&#x0153;sophageal and
  infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia of the invertebrate, and it has been shown (p. <a
  href="#page54">54</a>) how, by a process of concentration and cephalization, the foremost region
  of the infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia becomes the prosomatic region, and is directly comparable
  to the trigeminal region in the vertebrate; while the hindermost region is formed from the
  concentration of the mesosomatic ganglia, and is directly comparable to the medulla oblongata,
  <i>i.e.</i> to the vagus region of the vertebrate brain.</p>

  <p class="sp3">As far, then, as concerns the centres of origin of these two groups of nerves and
  their exits from the central nervous system, they are markedly homologous in the two groups of
  animals.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Comparison of the Cranial and Spinal Segmental Nerves.</span></p>

  <p>It has often been held that the arrangements of the vertebrate nervous system differ from those
  of other segmented animals in one important particular. The characteristic of the vertebrate is
  the origin of every segmental nerve from two roots, of which one contains the efferent fibres,
  while the other possesses a sensory ganglion, and contains only afferent fibres. This arrangement,
  which is found along the whole spinal cord of all vertebrates, is not found in the segmental
  nerves of the invertebrates; and as it is supposed that the simpler arrangement of the spinal cord
  was the primitive arrangement from which the vertebrate central nervous system was built up, it is
  often concluded that the animal from which the vertebrate arose must have possessed a series of
  nerve-segments, from each of which there arose bilaterally ventral (efferent) and dorsal
  (afferent) roots.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page153">{153}</span></div>

  <p>Now, the striking fact of the vertebrate segmental nerves consists in this, that, as far as
  their structure and the tissues which they innervate are concerned, the cranial segmental nerves
  are built up on the same plan as the spinal; but as far as concerns their exit from the central
  nervous system they are markedly different. A large amount of ingenuity, it is true, has been
  spent in the endeavour to force the cranial nerves into a series of segmental nerves, which arise
  in the same way as the spinal by two roots, of which the ventral series ought to be efferent and
  the dorsal series afferent, but without success. We must, therefore, consider the arrangement of
  the cranial segmental nerves by itself, separately from that of the spinal nerves, and the problem
  of the origin of the vertebrate segmental nerves admits of two solutions&mdash;either the cranial
  arrangement has arisen from a modification of the spinal, or the spinal from a simplification of
  the cranial. The first solution implies that the spinal cord arrangement is older than the
  cranial, the second that the cranial is the oldest.</p>

  <p>In my opinion, the evidence of the greater antiquity of the cranial region is overwhelming.</p>

  <p>The evidence of embryology points directly to the greater phylogenetic antiquity of the cranial
  region, for we see how, quite early in the development, the head is folded off, and the organs in
  that region thereby completed at a time when the spinal region is only at an early stage of
  development. We see how the first of the trunk somites is formed just posteriorly to the head
  region, and then more and more somites are formed by the addition of fresh segments posteriorly to
  the one first formed. We see how, in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the first formed parts of the skeleton are
  the branchial bars and the basi-cranial system, while the rudiments of the vertebr√¶ do not appear
  until the Petromyzon stage. We see how, with the elongation of the animal by the later addition of
  more and more spinal segments, organs, such as the heart, which were originally in the head,
  travel down, and the vagus and lateral-line nerves reach their ultimate destination. Again, we see
  that, whereas the cranial nerves, viz. the ocular motor, the trigeminal, facial, auditory,
  glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves, are wonderfully fixed and constant in all vertebrates, the
  only shifting being in the spino-occipital region, in fact, at the junction of the cranial and
  spinal region, the spinal nerves, on the other hand, are not only remarkably variable in number in
  different <span class="pagenum" id="page154">{154}</span>groups of animals, but that even in the
  same animal great variations are found, especially in the manner of formation of the
  limb-plexuses. Such marked meristic variation in the spinal nerves, in contrast to the fixed
  character of the cranial nerves, certainly points to a more recent formation of the former
  nerves.</p>

  <p>Also the observations of Assheton on the primitive streak of the rabbit, and on the growth in
  length of the frog embryo, have led him to the conclusion that, as in the rabbit so in the frog,
  there is evidence to show that the embryo is derived from two definite centres of growth: the
  first, phylogenetically the oldest, being a protoplasmic activity, which gives rise to the
  anterior end of the embryo; the second, one which gives rise to the growth in length of the
  embryo. This secondary area of proliferation coincides with the area of the primitive streak, and
  he has shown, in a subsequent paper, by means of the insertion of sable hairs into the unincubated
  blastoderm of the chick, that a hair inserted into the centre of the blastoderm appears at the
  anterior end of the primitive streak, and subsequently is found at the level of the most anterior
  pair of somites.</p>

  <p>He then goes on to say&mdash;</p>

  <p>"From these specimens it seems clear that all those parts in front of the first pair of
  mesoblastic somites&mdash;that is to say, the heart, the brain and medulla oblongata, the
  olfactory, optic, auditory organs and foregut&mdash;are developed from that portion of the
  unincubated blastoderm which lies anterior to the centre of the blastoderm, and that all the rest
  of the embryo is formed by the activity of the primitive streak area."</p>

  <p>In other words, the secondary area of growth, <i>i.e.</i> the primitive streak area, includes
  the whole of the spinal cord region, while the older primary centre of growth is coincident with
  the cranial region.</p>

  <p>In searching, then, for the origin of the segmental nerves, we must consider the type on which
  the cranial nerves are arranged rather than that of the spinal nerves.</p>

  <p>The first striking fact occurs at the spino-occipital region, where the spinal cord merges into
  the medulla oblongata, for here in the cervical region we find each spinal segment gives origin to
  three distinct roots, not two&mdash;a dorsal root, a ventral root, and a lateral root. This third
  root gives origin to the spinal accessory nerve, and in the region of the medulla oblongata these
  lateral roots merge directly into the roots of the vagus nerve; more anteriorly the same system
  <span class="pagenum" id="page155">{155}</span>continues as the roots of the glossopharyngeal
  nerve, as the roots of the facial nerve, and as a portion, especially the motor portion, of the
  trigeminal nerve. Now, all these nerves belong to a well-defined system of nerves, as Charles
  Bell<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> pointed out in 1830, a system of nerves
  concerned with respiration and allied mechanisms, such as laughing, sneezing, mastication,
  deglutition, etc., nerves innervating a set of muscles of very different kind from the ordinary
  body-muscles concerned with locomotion and equilibration. Also the centres from which these motor
  nerves arise are well defined, and form cell-masses in the central nervous system, quite separate
  from those which give origin to somatic muscles.</p>

  <p>This original idea of Charles Bell, after having been ignored for so long a time, is now seen
  to be a very right one, and it is an extraordinary thing that his enunciation of the dual nature
  of the spinal roots, which was, to his mind, of subordinate importance, should so entirely have
  overshadowed his suggestion, that in addition to the dorsal and ventral roots, a lateral system of
  nerves existed, which were not exclusively sensory or exclusively motor, but formed a separate
  system of respiratory nerves.</p>

  <p>Further, anatomists divide the striated muscles of the body into two great natural groups,
  characterized by a difference of origin and largely by a difference of appearance. The one set is
  concerned with the movements of internal organs, and is called visceral, the other is derived from
  the longitudinal sheet of musculature which forms the myotomes of the fish, and has been called
  parietal or somatic. The motor nerves of these two sets of muscles correspond with the lateral or
  respiratory and ventral roots respectively.</p>

  <p>Finally, it has been shown that the segments of which a vertebrate is composed are recognizable
  in the embryo by the segmented manner in which the musculature is laid down, and van Wijhe has
  shown that in the cranial region two sets of muscles are laid down segmentally, thus forming a
  dorsal and ventral series of commencing muscular segments. Of these the anterior segments of the
  dorsal series give origin to the striated muscles of the eye which are innervated by the IIIrd
  (oculomotor), IVth (trochlearis), and VIth (abducens) nerves, while the posterior segments give
  origin to the <span class="pagenum" id="page156">{156}</span>muscles from the cranium to the
  shoulder-girdle, innervated by the XIIth (hypoglossal) nerve. The ventral series of segments give
  origin to the musculature supplied by the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus
  nerves.</p>

  <p>Also, the afferent or sensory nerves of the skin over the whole of this head-region are
  supplied by the trigeminal nerve, while the afferent nerves to the visceral surfaces are supplied
  by the vagus, glossopharyngeal and facial nerves.</p>

  <p>In van Wijhe's original paper he arranged the segments belonging to the cranial nerves in the

  <p>As is seen in the table, van Wijhe attempts to arrange the cranial segmental nerves into dorsal
  and ventral roots, in accordance with the arrangement in the spinal region. In order to do this he
  calls the Vth, VIIth, IXth, and Xth nerves dorsal roots, although they are not purely sensory
  nerves, but contain motor fibres as well.</p>

  <p>It is not accidental that he should have picked out for his dorsal roots the very nerves which
  form Charles Bell's lateral series of roots, inasmuch as this system of lateral roots, apart from
  dorsal and ventral roots, really is, as Charles Bell thought, an important separate system,
  dependent upon a separate segmentation in the embryo of the musculature supplied by these roots.
  This segmentation may receive the name of <i>visceral</i> or <i>splanchnic</i> in
  contradistinction to <i>somatic</i>, since all the muscles without exception belong to the
  visceral group of striated muscles.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page157">{157}</span></div>

  <p>These observations of van Wijhe lead directly to the following conclusion. In the cranial
  region there is evidence of a double set of segments, which may be called somatic and splanchnic.
  The somatic segments, consisting of the outer skin and the body musculature, are <i>doubly</i>
  innervated as are those of the spinal cord by a series of ventral motor roots, the oculomotor or
  IIIrd nerve, the trochlear or IVth nerve, the abducens or VIth nerve, and the hypoglossal or XIIth
  nerve, and by a series of dorsal sensory roots, the sensory part of the trigeminal or Vth nerve.
  But the splanchnic segments are innervated by <i>single</i> roots, the vagus or Xth nerve,
  glossopharyngeal or IXth nerve, facial or VIIth nerve, and trigeminal or Vth nerve, which are
  mixed, containing both sensory and motor fibres, thus differing markedly from the arrangement of
  the spinal nerves.</p>

  <p class="sp3">From this sketch it follows that the arrangement seen in the spinal cord, would
  result from the cranial arrangement if this third system of lateral roots were left out. Further,
  since the cranial system is the oldest, we must search in the invertebrate ancestor for a
  tripartite rather than a dual system of nerve-roots for each segment; a system composed of a
  dorsal root supplying only the sensory nerves of the skin-surfaces, a lateral mixed root supplying
  the system connected with respiration with both sensory and motor fibres, and a ventral root
  supplying the motor nerves to the body-musculature.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Comparison of the Appendage Nerves of Limulus and Branchipus to the
  Lateral Root System of the Vertebrate.</span></p>

  <p>If the argument used so far is correct, and this tripartite system of nerve-roots, as seen in
  the cranial nerves of the vertebrate, really represents the original scheme of innervation in the
  pal√¶ostracan ancestor, then it follows that each segment of Limulus ought to be supplied by three
  nerves&mdash;(1), a sensory nerve supplying its own portion of the skin-surface of the prosomatic
  and mesosomatic carapaces; (2), a lateral mixed nerve supplying exclusively the appendage of the
  segment, for the appendages carry the respiratory organs; and (3), a motor nerve supplying the
  body-muscles of the segment.</p>

  <p>It is a striking fact that Milne-Edwards describes the nerve-roots in exactly this manner. The
  great characteristic of the nerve-roots <span class="pagenum" id="page158">{158}</span>in Limulus
  as in other arthropods is the large appendage-nerve, which is always a mixed nerve; in addition,
  there is a system of sensory nerves to the prosomatic and mesosomatic carapaces, called by him the
  epimeral nerves, which are purely sensory, and a third set of roots which are motor to the
  body-muscles, and possibly also sensory to the ventral surface between the appendages.</p>

  <p>Moreover, just as in the vertebrate central nervous system the centres of origin of the motor
  nerves of the branchial segmentation are distinct from those of the somatic segmentation, so we
  find, from the researches of Hardy, that a similar well-marked separation exists between the
  centres of origin of the motor nerves of the appendages and those of the somatic muscles in the
  central nervous system of Branchipus and Astacus.</p>

  <p>In the first place, he points out that the nervous system of Branchipus is of a very primitive
  arthropod type; that it is, in fact, as good an example of an ancient type as we are likely to
  find in the present day; a matter of some importance in connection with my argument, since the
  arthropod ancestor of the vertebrate, such as I am deducing from the study of Ammoc&#x0153;tes,
  must undoubtedly have been of an ancient type, more nearly connected with the strange forms of the
  trilobite era than with the crabs and spiders of the present day.</p>

  <p>His conclusions with respect to Branchipus may be tabulated as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1.  Each ganglion of the ventral chain is formed mainly for the innervation of the
  appendages.</p>

  <p>2.  Each ganglion is divided into an anterior and posterior division, which are connected
  respectively with the motor and sensory nerves of the appendages.</p>

  <p>3.  The motor nerves of the appendages arise as well-defined axis-cylinder processes of
  nerve-cells, which are arranged in well-defined groups in the anterior division of the
  ganglion.</p>

  <p>4.  A separate innervation exists for the muscles and sensory surfaces of the trunk. The
  trunk-muscles consist of long bundles, from which slips pass off to the skin in each segment; they
  are thus imperfectly segmented. In accordance with this, a diffuse system of nerve-fibres passes
  to them from certain cells on the dorsal surface of each lateral half of the ganglion. These
  cell-groups are therefore very distinct from those which give origin to the motor <span
  class="pagenum" id="page159">{159}</span>appendage-nerves, and, moreover, are not confined to the
  ganglion, but extend for some distance into the interganglionic region of the nerve-cords which
  connect together the ganglia of the ventral chain.</p>

  <p>Hardy's observations, therefore, combined with those of Milne-Edwards, lead to the conclusion
  that in such a primitive arthropod type as my theory postulates, each segment was supplied with
  separate sensory and motor somatic nerves, and with a pair of nerves of mixed function, devoted
  entirely to the innervation of the pair of appendages; that also, in the central nervous system,
  the motor nerve-centres were arranged in accordance with a double set of segmented muscles in two
  separate groups of nerve-cells. These nerve-cells in the one case were aggregated into
  well-defined groups, which formed the centres for the motor nerves of the markedly segmented
  muscles of the appendages, and in the other case formed a system of more diffused cells, less
  markedly aggregated into distinct groups, which formed the centres for the imperfectly segmented
  somatic muscles.</p>

  <p>Such an arrangement suggests that in the ancient arthropod type a double segmentation existed,
  viz. a segmentation of the body, and a segmentation due to the appendages. Undoubtedly, the
  segments originally corresponded absolutely as in Branchipus, and every appendage was attached to
  a well-defined separate body-segment. In, however, such an ancient type as Limulus, though the
  segmentation may be spoken of as twofold, yet the number of segments in the prosomatic and
  mesosomatic regions are much more clearly marked out by the appendages than by the divisions of
  the soma; for, in the prosomatic region such a fusion of somatic segments to form the tergal
  prosomatic carapace has taken place that the segments of which it is composed are visible only in
  the young condition, while in the mesosomatic region the separate somatic segments, though fused
  to form the mesosomatic carapace, are still indicated by the entapophysial indentations.</p>

  <p>Clearly, then, if the mesosomatic branchial appendages of forms related to Limulus were reduced
  to the branchial portion of the appendage, and that branchial portion became internal, just as is
  known to be the case in the scorpion group, we should obtain an animal in which the <i>mesosomatic
  region</i> would be characterized by a segmentation predominantly branchial, which might be
  termed, as in vertebrates, the <i>branchiomeric segmentation</i>, but yet would show <span
  class="pagenum" id="page160">{160}</span>indications of a corresponding somatic or <i>mesomeric
  segmentation</i>. The nerve supply to these segments would consist of&mdash;</p>

  <p>1.  The epimeral purely sensory nerves to the somatic surface, equivalent in the vertebrate to
  the ascending root of the trigeminal.</p>

  <p>2.  The mixed nerves to the internal branchial segments, equivalent in the vertebrate to the
  vagus, glossopharyngeal, and facial.</p>

  <p>3.  The motor nerves to the somatic muscles, equivalent in the vertebrate to the original
  nerve-supply to the somatic muscles belonging to these segments, <i>i.e.</i> to the muscles
  derived from van Wijhe's 4th, 5th, and 6th somites.</p>

  <p>Further, the centres of origin of these appendage-nerves would form centres in the central
  nervous system separate from the centres of the motor nerves to the somatic muscles, just as the
  centres of origin of the motor parts of the facial, vagus, and glossopharyngeal nerves form groups
  of cells quite distinct from the centres for the hypoglossal, abducens, trochlear, and oculomotor
  nerves.</p>

  <p>In fact, if the vertebrate branchial nerves are looked upon as the descendants of nerves which
  originally supplied branchial appendages, then every question connected with the branchial
  segmentation, with the origin and distribution of these nerves, receives a simple and adequate
  solution&mdash;a solution in exact agreement with the conclusion that the vertebrate arose from a
  pal√¶ostracan ancestor.</p>

  <p>It would, therefore, be natural to expect that the earliest fishes breathed by means of
  branchial appendages situated internally, and that the evidence for such appendages would be much
  stronger in them than in more recent fishes.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Although we know nothing of the nature of the respiratory apparatus in the extinct
  fishes of Silurian times, we have still living, in the shape of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, a possible
  representative of such types. If, then, we find, as is the case, that the respiratory apparatus of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes differs markedly from that of the rest of the fishes, and, indeed, from that of
  the adult form or Petromyzon, and that that very difference consists in a greater resemblance to
  internal branchial appendages in the case of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, then we may feel that the proof of
  the origin of the branchial apparatus of the vertebrate from the internal branchial appendages of
  the invertebrate has gained enormously.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page161">{161}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Respiratory Chamber of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>In order to make clear the nature of the branchial segments in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, I have divided
  the head-part of the animal by means of a longitudinal horizontal section into
  halves&mdash;ventral and dorsal&mdash;as shown in Figs. 63 and 64. These figures are each a
  combination of a section and a solid drawing. The animal was slit open by a longitudinal section
  in the neighbourhood of the gill-slits, and each half was slightly flattened out, so as to expose
  the ventral and dorsal internal surfaces respectively. The structures in the cut surface were
  drawn from one of a series of horizontal longitudinal sections taken through the head of the
  animal. These figures show that the head-region of Ammoc&#x0153;tes consists of two chambers, the
  contents of which are different. In front, an oral or stomod√¶al chamber, which contains the velum
  and tentacles, is enclosed by the upper and lower lips, and was originally separated by a septum
  from the larger respiratory chamber, which contains the separate pairs of branchi√¶. A glance at
  the two drawings shows clearly that Rathke's original description of this chamber is the natural
  one, for he at that time, looking upon <i>Ammoc&#x0153;tes branchialis</i> as a separate species,
  described the branchial chamber as containing a series of paired gills, with the gill-openings
  between consecutive gills. His branchial unit or gill, therefore, was represented by each of the
  so-called diaphragms, which, as seen in Figs. 63, 64, are all exactly alike, except the first and
  the last. Any one of these is represented in section in Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>, and
  represents a branchial unit in Rathke's view and in mine. Clearly, it may be described as a
  branchial appendage which projects into an open pharyngeal chamber, so that the series of such
  appendages divides the chamber into a series of compartments, each of which communicates with the
  exterior by means of a gill-slit, and with each other by means of the open space between opposing
  appendages.</p>

  <p>Each of these appendages possesses its own cartilaginous bar (<i>Br. cart.</i>), as explained
  in Chapter III.; each possesses its own branchial or visceral muscles (coloured blue in Figs. 63
  and 64), separated absolutely from the longitudinal somatic muscles (coloured dark red in Figs. 63
  and 64) by a space (<i>Sp.</i>) containing blood and peculiar fat-cells, etc. Each possesses its
  own afferent branchial blood-vessel from the ventral aorta, and its own efferent vessel to the
  dorsal aorta (Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>, <i>a. br.</i> and <i>v. br.</i>). Each possesses its
  own segmental nerve, which supplies its own branchial muscles and no others with motor fibres, and
  sends sensory fibres to the general surface of each appendage, as also to the special sense-organs
  in the shape of the epithelial pits (<i>S.</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>) arranged along the
  free edges of the diaphragms; each of these nerves possesses its own ganglion&mdash;the
  epibranchial ganglion.</p>

  <p>The work of Miss Alcock has shown that the segmental branchial nerve supplies solely and
  absolutely such an appendage or branchial <span class="pagenum" id="page165">{165}</span>segment,
  and does not supply any portion of the neighbouring branchial segments. The nerve-supply in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes gives no countenance to the view that the original unit was a branchial pouch,
  the two sides of which each nerve supplied, but is strong evidence that the original unit was a
  branchial appendage, which was supplied by a <i>single</i> nerve with both motor and sensory
  fibres.</p>

  <p>Any observer having before him only this picture of the respiratory chamber of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, upon which to base his view of a vertebrate respiratory chamber, would naturally
  look upon the branchial unit of a vertebrate as a gilled appendage projecting into the open cavity
  of the anterior part of the alimentary canal or pharynx. This is not, however, the usual
  conception. The branchial unit is ordinarily described as a gill-pouch, which possesses two
  openings or slits, an internal one into the lumen of the alimentary canal, and an external one
  into the surrounding medium. This view is based upon embryological evidence of the following
  character<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The alimentary canal of all vertebrates forms a tube stretching the whole length of the animal;
  the anterior part of this tube becomes pouched on each side at regular intervals, and the walls of
  each pouch becoming folded form the respiratory surfaces or gills. The openings of these separate
  pouches into the central lumen of the gut form the internal gill-pouch openings; the other
  extremity of the pouch approaches the external surface of the animal, and finally breaks through
  to form a series of external gill-pouch openings.</p>

  <p>From the mesoblastic tissue, between each gill-pouch, there is formed a supporting
  cartilaginous bar, to which are attached a system of branchial muscles, with their nerves and
  blood-vessels. These cartilaginous bars, in all fishes above the Cyclostomata, form a supporting
  framework for the internal gill-slit, so that the gills are situated externally to them; the more
  primitive arrangement is, as already mentioned, a system of cartilaginous bars, extra-branchial in
  position, so that the gills are situated internally to them.</p>

  <p>From this description of the mode of formation of the respiratory apparatus in water-breathing
  vertebrates the conception has arisen of the gill-pouch as the branchial unit, a conception which
  is absolutely removed from all idea of a branchial unit such as is found in an arthropod, viz. an
  appendage.</p>

  <p>This conception of spaces as units pervades the whole of embryology, and is the outcome of the
  gastrula theory&mdash;a theory which <span class="pagenum" id="page166">{166}</span>teaches that
  all animals above the Protozoa are derived from a form which by invagination of its external
  surface formed an internal cavity or primitive gut. From pouches of this gut other cavities were
  said to be formed, called c&#x0153;lomic cavities, and thus arose the group of c&#x0153;lomatous
  animals. To speak of the developmental history of animals in terms of spaces; to speak of the
  atrophy of a cavity as though such a thing were possible, is, to my mind, the wrong way of looking
  at the facts of anatomy. It resembles the description of a net as a number of holes tied together
  with string, which is not usually considered the best method of description.</p>

  <p>There are two ways in which a series of pouches can be formed from a simple tube without
  folding, either by a thinning at regular intervals of the original tissue surrounding the tube, or
  by the ingrowth into the tube of the surrounding tissue at regular intervals, thus&mdash;</p>

  <div class="ac w45 fcenter sp2">
    <a href="images/fig067.png" id="fig67"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig067.png" alt=""

    <div class="smaller ac">
      <p><span class="sc">Fig. 67.&mdash;Diagrams to show the two methods of
      Pouch-formation.</span></p>
      <p class="sp0">A, by the thinning of the mesoblast at intervals. B, by the ingrowth of
      mesoblast at intervals. <i>Ep.</i>, epiblast; <i>Mes.</i>, mesoblast; <i>Hy.</i>,
      hypoblast.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the first case (A) the formation of a pouch is the significant act, and therefore the
  branchial segments might be expressed in terms of pouches. In the second case (B) the formation of
  a pouch is <span class="pagenum" id="page167">{167}</span>brought about in consequence of the
  ingrowth of the mesoblastic tissues at intervals; here, although the end-result is the same as in
  the first case, the pouch-formation is only secondary, the true branchial unit is the mesoblastic
  ingrowth.</p>

  <p>The evidence all points directly to the second method of formation. Thus Shipley, in his
  description of the development of the lamprey, says&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The gill-slits appear to me to be the result of the ventral downgrowth of mesoblast taking
  place only at certain places, these forming the gill-bars. Between each downgrowth the hypoblastic
  lining of the alimentary canal remains in contact with the epiblast; here the gill-opening
  subsequently appears about the twenty-second day."</p>

  <p>Dohrn describes and gives excellent pictures of the growth of the diaphragms, as the
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes grows in size, pictures which are distinctly reminiscent of the corresponding
  illustrations given by Brauer of the growth of the internal gills in the scorpion embryo.</p>

  <p>Another piece of evidence confirmatory of the view that the branchial segments are really of
  the nature of internal appendages, as the result of which gill-pouches are formed, is given by the
  presence in each of these branchial bars or diaphragms of a separate c&#x0153;lomic cavity. From
  the walls of this cavity the branchial muscles and cartilaginous bar are formed.</p>

  <p>Now, from an embryological point of view, the vertebrate shows that it is a segmented animal by
  the formation of somites, which consist of a series of divisions of the c&#x0153;lom, of which the
  walls form a series of muscular and skeletal segments. In the head-region, as already mentioned,
  such c&#x0153;lomic divisions form two rows&mdash;a dorsal and a ventral set. From the walls of
  the dorsal set the somatic musculature is formed. From those of the ventral set the branchial
  musculature. From the latter also the branchial cartilaginous bars are formed. Thus Shipley, in
  his description of the development of the lamprey, says: "The mesoblast between the gills arranges
  itself into head-cavities, and the walls of these cavities ultimately form the skeleton of the
  gill-arches."</p>

  <p>Similarly, in the arthropod, the segments in the embryo are marked out by a series of
  c&#x0153;lomic cavities and Kishinouye has described in Limulus a separate c&#x0153;lomic cavity
  for every one of the mesosomatic or branchial segments, and he states that in Arachnida <span
  class="pagenum" id="page168">{168}</span>the segmental c&#x0153;lomic cavities extend into the
  limbs. These cavities both in the vertebrate and in the arthropod disappear before the adult
  condition is reached.</p>

  <p>The whole evidence thus points strongly to the conclusion that the true branchial segmental
  units are the branchial bars or diaphragms, not the pouches between them.</p>

  <p>It is possible to understand why such prominence has been given to the conception of the
  branchial unit as a gill-pouch rather than as a gill-appendage, when the extraordinary change of
  appearance in the respiratory chamber of the lamprey which occurs at transformation, is taken into
  consideration. This change is of a very far-reaching character, and consists essentially of the
  formation of a new alimentary canal in this region, whereby the pharyngeal chamber of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes is cut off posteriorly from the alimentary canal, and is confined entirely to
  respiratory purposes, its original lumen now forming a tube called the bronchus, which opens into
  the mouth and into a series of branchial pouches.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig68">68</a> I give diagrammatic illustrations taken from Nestler's paper to
  show the striking change which takes place at transformation, (A) representing three branchial
  segments of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and (B) the corresponding three segments of Petromyzon. The
  corresponding parts in the two diagrams are shown by the cartilages (<i>br. cart.</i>), the
  sense-organs (S), and the branchial veins (<i>V. br.</i>); the corresponding diaphragms are marked
  by the figures 1, 2, 3 respectively. As is clearly seen, it is perfectly possible in the latter
  case to describe the respiratory chamber, as Nestler has done, as divided into a series of
  separate smaller chambers&mdash;the gill-pouches&mdash;by means of a series of diaphragms or
  branchial bars. The surface of these gill-pouches is in part thrown into folds for respiratory
  purposes, and each gill-pouch opens, on the one hand, into the bronchus (<i>Bro.</i>), and, on the
  other, to the exterior by means of the gill-slit. The branchial unit in Petromyzon is, therefore,
  according to Nestler and other morphologists, the folded opposed surfaces of two contiguous
  diaphragms, and each one of the diaphragms is intersegmental between two gill-pouches.</p>

  <p>Nestler then goes on to describe the arrangement in Ammoc&#x0153;tes in the same terms,
  although there is no bronchus or gill-pouch, but only an open chamber into which these
  gill-bearing diaphragms project, which open chamber serves both for the passage of food and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page169">{169}</span>of the water for respiration. This is manifestly the
  wrong way to look at the matter: the adult form is derived from the larval, not <i>vice vers√¢</i>,
  and the transformation process shows exactly how the gills, in Rathke's sense, come together to
  form the bronchus and so make the gill-pouches of Petromyzon.</p>

  <p>When we bear in mind that almost all observers consider that the internal branchi√¶ of the
  scorpion group are directly derived from branchial appendages of a kind similar to those of
  Limulus, it is evident that a branchial appendage such as that of Ammoc&#x0153;tes might also have
  arisen from such an appendage, because in various respects it is easier to compare the branchial
  appendage of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, than that of the scorpion group, with that of Limulus.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the case of the scorpions, various suggestions have been made as to the manner in which such
  a conversion may have taken place. The most probable explanation is that given by Macleod, in
  which <span class="pagenum" id="page170">{170}</span>each of the branchi√¶ of the scorpion group is
  directly compared with the branchial part of the Limulus appendage which has sunk into and
  amalgamated with the ventral surface.</p>

  <p>According to this view, the modification which has taken place in transforming the branchial
  Limulus-appendage into the branchial scorpion-appendage is a further stage of the process by which
  the Limulus branchial appendage itself has been formed, viz. the getting rid of the free locomotor
  segments of the original appendage, thus confining the appendage more and more to the basal
  branchial portion. So far has this process been carried in the scorpion that all the free part of
  the appendage has disappeared; apparently, also, the intrinsic muscles of the appendage have
  vanished, with the possible exception of the post-stigmatic muscle, so that any direct comparison
  between the branchial appendages of Limulus and the scorpions is limited to the comparison of
  their branchi√¶, their nerves, and their afferent and efferent blood-vessels.</p>

  <p>In the case of Ammoc&#x0153;tes the comparison must be made not with air-breathing but with
  water-breathing scorpions, such as existed in past ages in the forms of Eurypterus, Pterygotus,
  Slimonia, and with the crowd of trilobite and Limulus-like forms which were in past ages so
  predominant in the sea; forms in some of which the branchial appendages had already become
  internal, but which, from the very fact of these forms being water-breathers, probably resembled,
  in respect of their respiratory apparatus, Limulus rather than the present-day scorpion.</p>

  <p class="sp3">On the assumption that the branchial appendages of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, like the
  branchial appendages of the scorpion group, are to a certain extent comparable with those of
  Limulus, it becomes a matter of great interest to inquire whether the mode in which respiration is
  effected in Ammoc&#x0153;tes resembles most that of Limulus or of the scorpion.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Origin of the Branchial Musculature.</span></p>

  <p>The difference between the movements of respiration in Limulus and those of the scorpions
  consists in the fact that, although in both cases respiration is effected mainly by dorso-ventral
  muscles, these muscles are not homologous in the two cases: in the former, the dorso-ventral
  appendage-muscles are mainly concerned, in the latter, the dorso-ventral somatic muscles.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page171">{171}</span></div>

  <p>The paper by Benham gives a full description of the musculature of Limulus, and according to
  his arrangement the muscles are divided into two sets, longitudinal and dorso-ventral. Of the
  latter, each mesosomatic segment possesses a pair of dorso-ventral muscles, attached to the
  mid-ventral mesosomatic entochondrite, and to the tergal surface (Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>,
  <i>Dv.</i>). These muscles are called by Benham the vertical mesosomatic muscles. I shall call
  them the somatic dorso-ventral muscles, in contradistinction to the dorso-ventral muscles of the
  branchial appendages. Of the latter, the two chief are the external branchial (Fig. <a
  href="#fig66">66</a>, <i>m<sub>3</sub></i>) and the posterior entapophysio-branchial (Fig. <a
  href="#fig66">66</a>, <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>); a third muscle is the anterior entapophysio-branchial
  (Fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a>, <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>). Of these muscles, the posterior
  entapophysio-branchial (<i>m<sub>1</sub></i>) is closely attached along the branchial
  cartilaginous bar up to its round-headed termination on the anterior surface of the appendage. The
  anterior entapophysio-branchial muscle (<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>) is attached to the branchial
  cartilage near the entapophysis.</p>

  <p>In the case of the scorpion, as described by Miss Beck, the branchial appendage has become
  reduced to the branchi√¶, and the intrinsic appendage-muscles have entirely disappeared, with the
  possible exception of the small post-stigmatic muscle; on the other hand, the dorso-ventral
  somatic muscles, which are clearly homologous with the corresponding muscles of Limulus, have
  remained, and become the essential respiratory muscles.</p>

  <p>Of these two possible types of respiratory movement it is quite conceivable that in the
  water-breathing scorpions of olden times and in their allies, the dorso-ventral muscles of their
  branchial appendages may have continued their <i>r√¥le</i> of respiratory muscles, and so have
  given origin to the respiratory muscles of the ancestors of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>The respiratory muscles of Ammoc&#x0153;tes are three in number, and have been described by
  Nestler and Miss Alcock as the adductor muscle, the striated constrictor muscle, and the tubular
  constrictor muscle (Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>, <i>m. add.</i>, <i>m.c.s.</i>, and
  <i>m.c.t.</i>). Of these, the constrictor muscle (Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a>, <i>m. con.
  str.</i>) is in close contact with its cartilaginous bar, while the adductor (Fig. <a
  href="#fig71">71</a>, <i>m. add.</i>) is attached to the cartilage only at its origin and
  insertion, and the tubular muscles (Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a>, <i>m. con. tub.</i>) have
  nothing whatever to do with the cartilage at all, being attached ventrally to the connective
  tissue in the neighbourhood <span class="pagenum" id="page172">{172}</span>of the ventral aorta
  (<i>V.A.</i>), and dorsally to the mid-line between the dorsal aorta (<i>D.A.</i>) and the
  notochord.</p>

  <p>The close relationship of the constrictor muscle to the cartilaginous branchial bar does not
  favour the surmise that this muscle is homologous with the dorso-ventral somatic muscle of the
  scorpion. It is, however, directly in accordance with the view that this muscle is homologous with
  one of the dorso-ventral appendage-muscles, such as the posterior entapophysio-branchial muscle
  (<i>m<sub>1</sub></i>, Fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a>) of the Limulus appendage, especially when the
  homology of the Ammoc&#x0153;tes branchial cartilage with the Limulus branchial cartilage is borne
  in mind. I am, therefore, inclined to look upon the constrictor and adductor muscles of the
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes branchial segment as more likely to have been derived from dorso-ventral muscles
  which belonged originally to a branchial appendage, such as we see in Limulus, than from
  dorso-ventral somatic muscles, such as the vertical mesosomatic muscles which are found both in
  Limulus and scorpion. In other words, I am inclined to hold the view that the somatic
  dorso-ventral muscles have disappeared in this region in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, while dorso-ventral
  appendage-muscles have been retained, <i>i.e.</i> the exact reverse to what has taken place in the
  air-breathing scorpion.</p>

  <p>I am especially inclined to this view because of the manner in which it fits in with and
  explains van Wijhe's results. Ever since Schneider divided the striated muscles of vertebrates
  into parietal and visceral, such a division has received general acceptance and, as far as the
  head-region is concerned, has received an explanation in van Wijhe's work; for Schneider's
  grouping corresponds exactly to the two segmentations of the head-mesoblast, discovered by van
  Wijhe, <i>i.e.</i> to the somatic and splanchnic striated muscles according to my nomenclature. Of
  these two groups the splanchnic or visceral striated musculature, innervated by the Vth, VIIth,
  IXth, and Xth nerves, which ought on this theory to be derived from the musculature of the
  corresponding appendages, is, speaking generally, dorso-ventral in direction in Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  and of the same character throughout; the somatic musculature, on the other hand, is clearly
  divisible, in the head region, into two sets&mdash;a spinal and a cranial set. The somatic muscles
  innervated by the spinal set of nerves, including in this term the spino-occipital or so-called
  hypoglossal nerves, are in Ammoc&#x0153;tes most sharply defined from all the other muscles of the
  body. They form the great dorsal and ventral longitudinal <span class="pagenum"
  id="page173">{173}</span>body-muscles, which extend dorsally as far forward as the nose and are
  developed embryologically quite distinctly from the others, being formed as muscle-plates
  (K√§stchen). On the other hand, the cranial somatic muscles are the eye-muscles, the formation of
  which resembles that of the visceral muscles, and not of the spinal somatic. Their direction is
  not longitudinal, but dorso-ventral; they cannot, in my opinion, be referred to the somatic
  trunk-muscles, and must, therefore, form a separate group to themselves. Thus the striated
  musculature of the Ammoc&#x0153;tes must be divided into (1) the visceral muscles; (2) the
  longitudinal somatic muscles; and (3) the dorso-ventral somatic muscles. Of these the 1st, on the
  view just stated, represent the original appendage-muscles; the 2nd belong to the spinal region,
  and will be considered with that region; the 3rd represent the original segmental dorso-ventral
  somatic muscles, which are so conspicuous in the musculature of the Limulus and the scorpion
  group.</p>

  <p>The discussion of this last statement will be given when I come to deal with the prosomatic
  segments of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. I wish, here, simply to point out that van Wijhe has shown that the
  eye-muscles develop from his 1st, 2nd, and 3rd dorsal mesoblastic segments, and therefore
  represent the somatic muscles belonging to those segments, while no development of any
  corresponding muscles takes place in the 4th, 5th, and 6th segments; so that if the eye-muscles
  represent a group of dorso-ventral somatic muscles, such muscles have been lost in the 4th, 5th,
  and 6th segments. The latter segments are, however, the glossopharyngeal and vagus segments, the
  branchial musculature of which is derived from the ventral segments of the mesoderm. In other
  words, van Wijhe's observations mean that the dorso-ventral somatic musculature has been lost in
  the branchial or mesosomatic region, while the dorso-ventral appendage musculature has been
  retained, and that, therefore, the mode of respiration in Ammoc&#x0153;tes more closely resembles
  that of Limulus than of Scorpio.</p>

  <p>In addition to these branchial muscles, another and very striking set of muscles is found in
  the respiratory region of Ammoc&#x0153;tes&mdash;the so-called tubular muscles. These muscles are
  of great interest, but as they are especially connected with the VIIth nerve, their consideration
  is best postponed to the chapter dealing with that nerve.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Also, in connection with the vagus group of nerves, special sense-organs are found
  in the skin covering this mesosomatic region, the so-called epithelial pit-organs (<i>Ep.
  pit.</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a>). They, too, are of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page174">{174}</span>great interest, but their consideration may also better be deferred to
  the chapter dealing with those special sense-systems known as the lateral line and auditory
  systems.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Comparison of the Branchial Circulation in Ammoc&#x0153;tes and
  Limulus.</span></p>

  <p>Closely bound up with the respiratory system is the nature of the circulation of blood through
  the gills. Before, therefore, proceeding to the consideration of the segments in front of those
  which carry branchi√¶, it is worth while to compare the circulation of the blood in the gills of
  Limulus and of Ammoc&#x0153;tes respectively.</p>

  <p>In all the higher vertebrates the blood circulates in a closed system of capillaries, which
  unite the arterial with the venous systems. In all the higher invertebrates this capillary system
  can hardly be said to exist; the blood is pumped from the arterial system into blood spaces or
  lacun√¶, and thus comes into immediate contact with the tissues. From these it is collected into
  veins, and so returned to the heart. There is, in fact, no separate lymph-system in the higher
  invertebrates; the blood-system and lymph-system are not yet differentiated from each other. This
  also is the case in Ammoc&#x0153;tes; here, too, in many places the blood is poured into a lacunar
  space, and collected thence by the venous system; a capillary system is only in its commencement
  and a lymph-system does not yet exist. In this part of its vascular system Ammoc&#x0153;tes again
  resembles the higher invertebrates more than the higher vertebrates.</p>

  <p>This resemblance is still more striking when the circulation in the respiratory organs of the
  two animals is compared. A branchial appendage is essentially an appendage whose vascular system
  is arranged for the special purpose of aerating blood. In the higher vertebrates such a purpose is
  attained by the pulmonary capillaries, in Limulus by the division of the posterior surface of the
  basal part of the appendage into thin lamellar plates, the interior of each of which is filled
  with blood. The two surfaces of each lamella are kept parallel to each other by means of fibrous
  or cellular strands forming little pillars at intervals, called by Macleod "colonettes." A
  precisely similar arrangement is found in the scorpion gill-lamella, as seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig69">69</a>, A, taken from Macleod. In Ammoc&#x0153;tes there are no well-defined
  branchial capillaries, but the blood circulates, as in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page175">{175}</span>the invertebrate gill, in a lamellar space; here, also, as Nestler has
  shown, the opposing walls of the gill-lamella are held in position by little pillar-like cells, as
  seen in Fig. <a href="#fig69">69</a>, B, taken from his paper.</p>

  <p>In this representative of the earliest vertebrates the method of manufacturing an efficient
  gill out of a lacunar blood-space is precisely the same as that which existed in Limulus and the
  scorpion, and, therefore, as that which existed in the dominant invertebrate group at the time
  when vertebrates first appeared. This similarity indicates a close resemblance between the
  circulatory systems of the two groups of animals, and therefore, to the superficial inquirer,
  would indicate an homology between the heart of the vertebrate and the heart of the higher
  invertebrate; but the former is situated ventrally to the gut and the nervous system, while the
  latter is composed of a long vessel which lies in the mid-dorsal line immediately under the
  external dorsal covering. Indeed, this ventral position of the heart in the one group of animals
  and its dorsal position in the other, combined with the corresponding positions of the central
  nervous system, is one of the principal reasons why all the advocates of the origin of vertebrates
  from the Appendiculata, with the single exception of myself, feel compelled to reverse the dorsal
  and ventral surfaces in deriving the vertebrate from the invertebrate. But there is one most
  important fact which ought to make us hesitate before accepting the homology of the dorsal heart
  of the arthropod with the ventral heart of the vertebrate&mdash;The heart in all invertebrates is
  a systemic heart, <i>i.e.</i> drives the arterial blood to the different organs of the body, and
  then the veins carry it back to the respiratory organ, from whence it passes to the heart.</p>

      Ammoc&#x0153;tes (after Nestler).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The only exception to this scheme is found in the vertebrate where the heart is essentially a
  branchial heart, the blood being <span class="pagenum" id="page176">{176}</span>driven from the
  heart to the ventral aorta, from which by the branchial arteries it is carried to the gills, and
  then, after aeration, is collected into the dorsal aorta, whence it is distributed over the body.
  The distributing systemic vessel is the dorsal aorta, not the heart which belongs essentially to
  the ventral venous system. This constitutes a very strong reason for believing that the systemic
  heart of the invertebrate is not homologous with the heart of the vertebrate. How, then, did the
  vertebrate heart arise?</p>

  <p>Let us first see how the blood is supplied to the gills in Limulus.</p>

  <div class="ac w40 fcenter sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In Limulus the blood flows into the lamell√¶ from sinuses or blood-spaces (<i>b.s.</i>, Fig. <a
  href="#fig66">66</a>) at the base of each of the lamell√¶, which sinuses are filled by a vessel
  which may be called the branchial artery, since it is the afferent branchial vessel. On each side
  of the middle line of the ventral surface of the body a large longitudinal venous sinus exists,
  called by Milne-Edwards the venous collecting sinus, <i>L.V.S.</i>, (Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a>
  and Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>), which gives off to each of the branchial appendages on that
  side a well-defined afferent branchial vessel&mdash;the branchial artery (<i>a. br.</i>). The
  blood of the branchial artery flows into the blood-spaces between the anterior and posterior
  lamin√¶ of the appendage and thence into the gill-lamell√¶, from which it is collected into an
  efferent vessel or branchial vein, termed by Milne-Edwards the branchio-cardiac canal, which
  carries it back to the dorsal heart. The position of the branchial artery and vein is shown in
  Fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a>, which represents a section through the branchial appendage of
  Limulus at right angles to the cartilaginous branchial bar (<i>br. cart.</i>), just as Fig. <a
  href="#fig65">65</a> represents a section through the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page177">{177}</span>branchial appendage of Ammoc&#x0153;tes at right angles to the
  cartilaginous branchial bar.</p>

  <p>Further, the observations of Blanchard, Milne-Edwards, Ray Lankester, and Benham concur in
  showing that in both Limulus and the scorpion group a striking and most useful connection exists
  between the heart and these two collecting venous sinuses, in the shape of a segmentally arranged
  series of muscular bands (<i>V.p.</i>, Fig. 70 and Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>), attached, on the
  one hand, to the pericardium, and on the other to the venous collecting sinus on each side. These
  muscular bands, to which Lankester and Benham have given the name of 'veno-pericardial muscles,'
  are so different in appearance from the rest of the muscular substance, that Milne-Edwards did not
  recognize them as muscular, but called them 'brides transparentes.' Blanchard speaks of them in
  the scorpion as 'ligaments contractiles,' and considers that they play an important part in
  assisting the pulmonary circulation; for, he says, "en mettant a nu une portion du c&#x0153;ur, on
  remarque que ces battements se font sentir sur les ligaments contractiles, et determinent sur les
  poches pulmonaires une pression qui fait aussitot refluer et remonter le sang dans les vaisseaux
  pneumocardiaques." Lankester, in discussing the veno-pericardial muscles of Limulus and of the
  scorpions, says that these muscles probably contract simultaneously with the heart and are of
  great importance in assisting the flow through the pulmonary system. More recently Carlson has
  investigated the action of these muscles in the living Limulus and found that they act
  simultaneously with the muscles of respiration.</p>

  <p>Precisely the same arrangement of veno-pericardial muscles and of longitudinal venous
  collecting sinuses occurs in the scorpions. It is one of the fundamental characters of the group,
  and we may fairly assume that a similar arrangement existed in the extinct forms from which I
  imagine the vertebrate to have arisen. The further consideration of this group of muscles will be
  given in Chapter IX.</p>

  <p>Passing now to the condition of the branchial blood-vessels of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, we see that
  the blood passes into the gill-lamell√¶ from a blood-space in the appendage, which can hardly be
  dignified by the name of a blood-vessel. This blood-space is supplied by the branchial artery
  which arises segmentally from the ventral aorta (<i>V.A.</i>), as seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig71">71</a> (taken from Miss Alcock's paper). From the gill-lamell√¶ the blood is
  collected into an efferent or branchial vein (<i>v. br.</i>), which <span class="pagenum"
  id="page178">{178}</span>runs, as seen in Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>, along the free edge of the
  diaphragm, and terminates in the dorsal aorta.</p>

  <p>The ventral aorta is a single vessel near the heart, but at the commencement of the thyroid it
  divides into two, and so forms two ventral longitudinal vessels, from which the branchial arteries
  arise segmentally.</p>

  <p>From this description it is clear that the vascular supply of the branchial segment of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes would resemble most closely the vascular supply of the Limulus branchial
  appendage, if the ventral aorta of the former was derived from two longitudinal veins, homologous
  with the paired longitudinal venous sinuses of the latter.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page179">{179}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3"><i>A priori</i>, such a derivation seems highly improbable; and yet it is precisely
  the manner in which embryology teaches us that the heart and ventral aorta of the vertebrate have
  arisen.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Origin of the Invertebrate Heart and the Origin of the
  Vertebrate Heart.</span></p>

  <p>Not only does the vertebrate heart differ from that of the invertebrate, in that it is
  branchial while the latter is systemic, but also it is unique in its mode of formation in the
  embryo. In the Appendiculata the heart is formed as a single organ in the mid-dorsal line by the
  growth of the two lateral plates of mesoblast dorsalwards, the heart being formed where they meet.
  In Mammalia and Aves, the heart and ventral aorta commence as a pair of longitudinal veins, one on
  each side of the commencing notochord.</p>

  <p>If the embryo be removed from the yolk, the surface of the embryo covering these two venous
  trunks can be spoken of as the ventral surface of the embryo at that stage, and indeed we find
  that in the present day there is an increasing tendency to speak of this surface as the ventral
  surface of the embryo. Thus, Mitsukuri, in his studies of chelonian embryos, lays great stress on
  the importance of surface views and when the embryo has been removed from the yolk, figures and
  speaks of its ventral surface. So, also, Locy and Neal find that the best method of seeing the
  early segments of the embryo is to remove the embryo from the yolk, and examine what they speak of
  as a ventral view. At the period, then, before the formation of the throat, we may say that on the
  ventral surface of the embryo a pair of longitudinal venous sinuses are found, one on each side of
  the mid-ventral line, which are in the same position with respect to the mid-axis of the embryo as
  are the longitudinal venous sinuses in Limulus.</p>

  <p>The next step is the formation of the throat by the extension of the layers of the embryo
  laterally to meet in the mid-line and so form the pharynx, with the consequence that a new ventral
  surface is formed; these two veins, as is well known, travel round also, and, meeting together in
  the new mid-ventral line, form the subintestinal vein, the heart, and the ventral aorta.</p>

  <p>What is true of Mammalia and Aves, has been shown by P. Mayer to be true universally among
  vertebrates, so that in all cases the heart and ventral aorta have arisen by the coalescence in
  the new mid-ventral <span class="pagenum" id="page180">{180}</span>line of two longitudinal venous
  channels, which were originally situated one on each side of the notochord, in what was then the
  ventral surface of this part of the embryo. This history is especially instructive in showing how
  the pharyngeal region is formed by the growing round of the lateral mesoblast, <i>i.e.</i> the
  muscular and other mesoblastic tissues of the branchial segments, and how the two longitudinal
  veins take part in this process. The phylogenetic interpretation of this embryological fact seems
  to be, that the new ventral surface of the vertebrate in this region is formed, not only by the
  branchial appendages, but also by the growth ventrally of that part of the original ventral
  surface which covered each longitudinal venous sinus.</p>

  <p>The following out of the consecutive clues, which one after the other arise in harmonious
  succession as the necessary sequence of the original working hypothesis, brings even now into view
  the manner in which the respiratory portion of the alimentary canal arose, and gives strong hints
  as to the position of that part of the arthropod which gave origin to the notochord. Here I will
  say no more at present, for the origin of the new alimentary canal of the vertebrate and of the
  notochord will be more fittingly discussed as a whole, after all the other organs of the
  vertebrate have been compared with the corresponding organs of the arthropod.</p>

  <p>The strong evidence that the vertebrate heart was formed from a pair of longitudinal venous
  sinuses on the ventral side of the central canal, carries with it the conclusion that the original
  single median dorsal heart of the arthropod is not represented in the vertebrate, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page181">{181}</span>for the dorsal aorta cannot by any possibility represent
  that heart.</p>

  <p>Although it is not now functional the original existence of so important an organ as a dorsal
  heart may have left traces of its former presence; if so, such traces would be most likely to be
  visible in the lowest vertebrates, just as the median eyes are much more evident in them than in
  the higher forms. In Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a> the position of the dorsal heart is shown in
  Limulus, and in Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a> the shape and extent of this dorsal heart is shown.
  It extends slightly into the prosomatic region, and thins down to a point there, runs along the
  length of the animal and finally thins down to a point at the caudal end.</p>

  <p>The heart is surrounded by a pericardium, from which at regular intervals a number of
  dorso-ventral muscles pass, to be inserted into the longitudinal venous sinus on each side. These
  veno-pericardial muscles are absolutely segmental with the mesosomatic segments, and are confined
  to that region, with the exception of two pairs in the prosomatic region. Their homologies will be
  discussed later.</p>

  <p>Any trace of a heart such as we have just described must be sought for in Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  between the central nervous system and the mid-line dorsally. Now, in this very position a large
  striking mass of tissue is found, represented in section in Fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a>,
  <i>f</i>. It forms a column of similar tissue along the whole mid-dorsal region, except at the two
  extremities; it tapers away in the caudal region, and headwards grows thinner and thinner, so that
  no trace of it is seen anterior to the commencement of the branchial region. It resembles in its
  dorsal position, in its shape, and in its size a dorsal heart-tube such as is seen in Limulus and
  elsewhere, but it differs from such a tube in its extension headwards. The heart-tube of Limulus
  ceases at the anterior end of the mesosomatic region, this fat-column of Ammoc&#x0153;tes at the
  posterior end. In its structure there is not the slightest sign of anything of the nature of a
  heart; it is a solid mass of closely compacted cells, and the cells are all very full of fat,
  staining intensely black with osmic acid. Nowhere else in the whole body of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is
  such a column of fat to be found. It is not skeletogenous tissue with cells of the nature of
  cartilage-cells, as Gegenbaur thought and as Balfour has depicted (Vol. II., Fig. 315) in his
  'Comparative Embryology,' as though this tissue were a part of the vertebral column, but is simply
  fat-cells, such as might easily have taken the place of some other previously existing organ.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page182">{182}</span></div>

  <p>I do not know how to decide the question which thus arises. Supposing, for the sake of
  argument, that this column of fat-cells has really taken the place of the original dorsal heart,
  what criterion would there be as to this? The heart <i>ex hypothesi</i> having ceased to function,
  the muscular tissue would not remain, and the space would be filled up, presumably with some form
  of connective tissue. As likely as not, the connective tissue might take the form of fatty tissue,
  the storage of fat being a physiological necessity to an animal, while at the same time no special
  organ has been developed for such a purpose, but fat is being laid down in all manner of places in
  the body.</p>

  <p>This dorsal fat-column, as it is seen in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, is not found in the higher
  vertebrates, so that it possesses, at all events, the significance of being a peculiarity of
  ancient times before the vertebrate skeletal column was formed.</p>

  <p>I mention it here in connection with my view as to the origin of vertebrates, because there it
  is, in the very place where the dorsal heart ought to have been. For my own part, I should not
  have expected that a muscular organ such as the heart would leave any trace of itself if it
  disappeared, so that its absence in the dorsal region of the vertebrate does not seem to me in the
  slightest degree to invalidate my theory.</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>From the close similarity of structure and position between the branchial skeleton of Limulus
    and of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, as given in the preceding chapter, it logically follows that the
    branchi√¶ of Ammoc&#x0153;tes must be homologous with the branchi√¶ of Limulus. But the
    respiratory apparatus of Limulus consists of branchial appendages. It follows, therefore, that
    the branchi√¶ of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and consequently of the vertebrates, must have been derived
    from branchial appendages, and as they are internal, not external, such branchial appendages
    must have been of the nature of 'sunk-in' branchial appendages. Such internal appendages are
    characteristic of the scorpion tribe, and of, perhaps, the majority of the Pal√¶ostraca, for no
    external respiratory appendages have been discovered in any of the sea-scorpions.</p>
    <p>In the vertebrates&mdash;and it is especially well shown in Ammoc&#x0153;tes&mdash;a double
    segmentation exists in the head-region, a body or somatic segmentation, and a branchial or
    splanchnic segmentation, respectively expressed by the terms mesomeric and branchiomeric
    segmentations. The nerves which supply the latter segments form a very well-marked group
    (Charles Bell's system of lateral or respiratory nerves) which do not conform to the system of
    spinal nerves, for they do not arise from separate motor and sensory roots, but are mixed nerves
    from the very beginning.</p>
    <p>The system of cranial segmental nerves is older than the spinal system, and cannot,
    therefore, be derived from it, but can be arranged as a system supplying two segments, somatic
    and splanchnic, which differ in the following way: Each somatic segment is supplied by two
    roots, motor and sensory respectively, as in the spinal cord segments, while each splanchnic
    segment possesses only one root, which is mixed in function.</p>
    <p>The peculiarities of the grouping of the cranial segmental nerves, which have hitherto been
    unexplained, immediately receive a straightforward and satisfactory explanation if the
    splanchnic or branchiomeric segments owe their origin to a system of appendages after the style
    of those of Limulus.</p>
    <p>In Limulus and all the Arthropoda, the segmentation is double, being composed of (1) somatic
    or body-segments, constituting the mesomeric segmentation; (2) appendage-segments, which, seeing
    that they carry the branchi√¶, constitute a branchiomeric segmentation. Similarly to the cranial
    region of the vertebrate, the nerves which supply the somatic segments arise from separate
    sensory and motor roots, while the single nerve which supplies each appendage contains all the
    fibres for the appendage, both motor and sensory.</p>
    <p>It follows from this that the branchial segments supplied by the vagus and glossopharyngeal
    nerves ought to have arisen from appendages bearing branchi√¶.</p>
    <p>Although the evidence of such appendages has entirely disappeared in the higher vertebrates,
    together with the disappearance of branchi√¶, and is not strikingly apparent in the higher
    gill-bearing fishes, yet in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, so great is the difference here from all other
    fishes, it is natural to describe the pharyngeal or respiratory chamber as a chamber into which
    a symmetrical series of respiratory appendages, the so-called diaphragms, are dependent. Each of
    these appendages possesses its own mixed nerve, glossopharyngeal or vagus, <span class="pagenum"
    id="page184">{184}</span>its own cartilage, its own set of visceral muscles, its own
    sense-organs, just as do the respiratory appendages of Limulus.</p>
    <p>The branchial unit in the vertebrate is not the gill-pouch, but the branchial bar or
    appendage between the pouches. Embryology shows how each such appendage grows inwards, how a
    c&#x0153;lomic cavity is formed in it, similarly to the ingrowing of the branchial appendage in
    scorpions.</p>
    <p>We do not know how the pal√¶ostracan sea-scorpions breathed; they resemble the scorpion of the
    present day somewhat in form, but they are in many respects closely allied to Limulus. The
    present-day scorpion is a land animal, and the muscles by which he breathes are dorso-ventral
    somatic muscles, while those of Limulus are the appendage-muscles.</p>
    <p>The old sea-scorpions very probably used their appendage-muscles after the Limulus fashion,
    being water-breathers, even although their respiratory appendages were no longer free but sunk
    in below the surface of the body. The probability that such was the case is increased after
    consideration of the method of breathing in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, for the respiratory muscles of the
    latter animal are directly comparable with the muscles of the respiratory appendages of Limulus,
    and are not somatic. Even the gills themselves of Ammoc&#x0153;tes are built up in the same
    fashion as are those of Limulus and the scorpions. The conception of the branchial unit as a
    gill-bearing appendage, not a gill-pouch, immediately explains the formation of the vertebrate
    heart, which is so strikingly different from that of all invertebrate hearts, in that it
    originates as a branchial and not as a systemic heart, and is formed by the coalescence of two
    longitudinal veins.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The origin of these two longitudinal veins is immediately apparent if the
    vertebrate arose from a pal√¶ostracan, for in Limulus and the whole scorpion tribe, in which the
    heart is a systemic heart, the branchi√¶ are supplied with blood from two large longitudinal
    venous sinuses, situated on each side of the middle line of the animal in an exactly
    corresponding position to that of the two longitudinal veins, which come together to form the
    heart and ventral aorta of the vertebrate. The consideration of the respiratory apparatus and of
    its blood-supply in the vertebrate still further points to the origin of vertebrates from the
    Pal√¶ostraca.</p>

  </div>

  <p>I have now given my reasons why I consider that the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves were
  originally the nerves belonging to a series of mesosomatic branchial appendages, each of which is
  still traceable in the respiratory chamber of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and gives the type-form from which
  to search for other serially homologous, although it may be specially modified, segments.</p>

  <p class="sp3">As long as the branchial unit consisted of the gill-pouch the segments of the
  head-region were always referred to such units, hence we find Dohrn and Marshall picturing to
  themselves the ancestor of vertebrates as possessing a series of branchial pouches right up to the
  anterior end of the body. Marshall speaks of olfactory organs as branchial sense-organs; Dohrn of
  the mouth as formed by the coalescence of gill-slits, of the trigeminal nerve as supplying
  modified branchial segments, etc.; thus a picture of an animal is formed such as never lived on
  this earth, or could be reasonably imagined to have lived on it. Yet Dohrn's conceptions of the
  segmentation were sound, his interpretation only was in fault, because he was obliged to express
  his segments in terms of the gill-pouch unit. Once abandon that point of view and take as the unit
  a branchial appendage, then immediately we see that in the region in front of the branchi√¶ we may
  still have segments <span class="pagenum" id="page186">{186}</span>homologous to the branchial
  segments, originally characterized by the presence of appendages, but that such appendages need
  never have carried branchi√¶. The new mouth may have been formed by such appendages, which would
  express Dohrn's suggestion of its formation by coalesced gill-slits; the olfactory organ may have
  been the sense-organ belonging to an antennal appendage, which would be what Marshall really meant
  in calling it a branchial sense-organ.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Facial Nerve and the Foremost Respiratory Segment.</span></p>

  <p>This simple alteration of the branchiomeric unit from a gill-pouch to an appendage, which may
  or may not bear branchi√¶, immediately sheds a flood of light on the segmentation of the
  head-region, and brings to harmony the chaos previously existing. Let us, then, follow out its
  further teachings. Next anteriorly to the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves comes the facial
  nerve; a nerve which supplies the hyoid segment, or, rather, according to van Wijhe the two hyoid
  segments, for embryologically there is evidence of two segments. As already mentioned, the facial
  nerve is usually included in the trigeminal or pro-otic group of nerves, the opisthotic group
  being confined to the glossopharyngeal and vagus. This inclusion of the facial nerve into the
  pro-otic group of nerves forms one of the main reasons why this group has been supposed to have
  originally supplied gill-pouch segments, for the hyoid segment is clearly associated with
  branchi√¶.</p>

  <p>When, however, we examine Ammoc&#x0153;tes (<i>cf.</i> Figs. 63 and 64) it is clear that the
  foremost of the segments forming the respiratory chamber, which must be classed with the rest of
  the mesosomatic or opisthotic segments, is that supplied by the facial nerves.</p>

  <p>An examination of this respiratory chamber shows clearly that there are six pairs of branchial
  appendages or diaphragms, which are all exactly similar to each other. These are those already
  considered, the foremost of which are supplied by the IXth or glossopharyngeal nerves. Immediately
  anterior to this glossopharyngeal segment is seen in the figures the segment supplied by the VIIth
  or facial nerves. It is so much like the segments belonging to the glossopharyngeal and vagus
  nerves as to make it certain that we are dealing here with a branchial segment, composed of a pair
  of branchial appendages similar to those in the other cases, except that the cartilaginous bar is
  here replaced by a bar of muco-cartilage and the branchi√¶ are confined to the posterior part of
  each appendage. The anterior portion is, as is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig74">74</a>, largely
  occupied by blood-spaces, but in addition carries the ciliated groove (<i>ps. br.</i>) called by
  Dohrn 'pseudo-branchiale Rinne.' This groove leads directly into the thyroid gland, which is a
  large bilateral organ situated in the middle line, as seen in Fig. <a href="#fig80">80</a> and
  Fig. <a href="#fig85">85</a>. As shown by Miss Alcock, the facial nerve supplies this thyroid
  gland, as well as the posterior hyoid branchial segment, and, as pointed out by Dohrn, there is
  every reason to consider this thyroid gland as indicative of a separate segment, especially when
  van Wijhe's statement that the hyoid segment is in reality double is taken into account.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page188">{188}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">The evidence, then, of Ammoc&#x0153;tes points directly to this conclusion: The
  facial nerves represent the foremost of the mesosomatic group of nerves, and supply two segments,
  which have amalgamated with each other. The most posterior of these, the hyoid segment, is a
  branchial segment of the same character as those supplied by the vagus and glossopharyngeal
  nerves; represents, therefore, the foremost pair of branchial appendages. The anterior or thyroid
  segment, on the other hand, differs from the rest in that, instead of branchi√¶, it carries the
  thyroid gland with its two ciliated grooves. If this segment, which is the foremost of the
  mesosomatic segments, also indicates a pair of appendages which carry the thyroid gland instead of
  branchi√¶, then it follows that this pair of appendages has joined together in the mid-line
  ventrally and thus formed a single median organ&mdash;the thyroid gland. If, then, we find that
  the foremost of the mesosomatic appendages in the Pal√¶ostraca was really composed of two pairs of
  appendages, of which the most posterior carried branchi√¶, while the anterior pair had amalgamated
  in the mid-line ventrally, and carried some special organ instead of branchi√¶, then the
  accumulation of coincidences is becoming so strong as to amount to proof of the correctness of our
  line of investigation.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The First Mesosomatic Segment in Limulus and its Allies.</span></p>

  <p>What, then, is the nature of the foremost pair of mesosomatic appendages in Limulus. They
  differ from the rest of the mesosomatic appendages in that they do not carry branchi√¶, and instead
  of being <span class="pagenum" id="page189">{189}</span>separate are joined together in the
  mid-line ventrally to form a single terminal plate-like appendage known as the operculum. On its
  posterior surface the operculum carries the genital duct on each side.</p>

  <p>So also in the scorpion group, the operculum is always found and always carries the genital
  ducts.</p>

  <p>A survey of the nature of the opercular appendage demonstrates the existence of three different
  types&mdash;</p>

  <p>1.  That of Limulus, in which the operculum is free, and carries only the terminations of the
  genital ducts. In this type the duct on each side opens to the exterior separately (Fig. <a
  href="#fig75">75</a>).</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>2.  The type of Scorpio, Androctonus, Buthus, etc., in which the operculum is not free, but
  forms part of the ventral surface of the body-wall, but, like Limulus, carries only the
  terminations of the genital ducts. In this type the duct on each side terminates in a common
  chamber (vagina or uterus), which communicates with the exterior by a single external median
  opening. This common chamber, or uterus (<i>Ut.</i>), extends the whole breadth of the operculum
  (as seen in Fig. <a href="#fig76">76</a>), and is limited to that segment.</p>

  <p>3. The type of Thelyphonus, Hypoctonus, Phrynus, and other members of the Pedipalpi, in which
  the operculum forms a part of the ventral surface of the body wall, but no longer covers only the
  termination of the genital apparatus. It really consists of two parts, a median anterior, which
  covers the terminal genital apparatus, <span class="pagenum" id="page190">{190}</span>and a
  lateral posterior, which covers the first pair of gills, or lung-books, as they are called. In
  this type (Fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a>) the genital ducts terminate in a common chamber or
  uterus, the nature of which will be further considered.</p>

  <p>As has been pointed out by Blanchard, the terminal genital organs of the scorpions and the
  Pedipalpi vary considerably in the different genera, especially the male genital organs. The
  general type of structure is the same, and consists in both male and female of vasa deferentia,
  which come together to form a common chamber before the actual opening to the exterior. This
  common chamber has been called in the female scorpion the vagina, or in Thelyphonus the uterus. I
  shall use the latter term, in accordance with Tarnani's work, and the corresponding chamber in the
  male will be the <i>uterus masculinus</i>.</p>

  <p>A considerable discussion has taken place about the method of action of the external genital
  organs in the members of the scorpion tribe, into which it is hardly necessary to enter here. The
  evidence points to the conclusion that in all these forms the operculum covers a median single
  chamber or uterus, into which the genital ducts open on each side, the main channels of emission
  being provided with a massive chitinous internal framework. We may feel certain that in the old
  extinct sea-scorpions, Eurypterus, etc., a similar arrangement existed, and that therefore in them
  also the median portion of the operculum covered a median chamber or uterus composed of the
  amalgamation of the terminations of the two genital ducts, which were originally separate, as in
  Limulus.</p>

  <p>The observations of Schmidt, Zittel, and others show that the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page191">{191}</span>operculum in the old extinct sea-scorpions, Eurypterus, Pterygotus, etc.,
  belonged to the type of Thelyphonus, rather than to that of Limulus or Scorpio. In Fig. <a
  href="#fig78">78</a> I give a picture from Schmidt of the ventral aspect of Eurypterus, and by the
  side of it a picture of the isolated operculum. Schmidt considers that there were five
  branchi√¶-bearing segments constituting the mesosoma, the foremost of which formed the operculum.
  Such operculum is often found isolated, and is clearly composed of two lateral appendages fused
  together in the middle line, of such a nature as to form a median elongated tongue, which lies
  between and separates the first three pairs of branchial segments. This median tongue, together
  with the anterior and median portion of the operculum, concealed, in all probability, according to
  Schmidt, the terminal parts of the genital organs, just as the median part of the operculum in
  Phrynus and Thelyphonus conceals the complicated terminal portions of the genital organs. The
  posterior part of the operculum, like that of Phrynus and Thelyphonus, carried the first pair of
  branchi√¶, so Schmidt thinks from the evidence of markings on some specimens.</p>

  <p>Apparently an opercular appendage of this kind is in reality the result of a fusion of the
  genital operculum with the first branchial appendage in forms such as the scorpion; for, in order
  that the tergal plates may correspond in number with the sternal in Eurypterus, etc., it is
  necessary to consider that the operculum is composed of two sternites joined together. Similarly
  in Thelyphonus, Phrynus, etc., this numerical correspondence is only observed if the operculum is
  looked upon as double.</p>

  segment carried the terminations of the genital organs; these I have represented, in accordance
  with our knowledge of the nature of these organs in the present-day scorpions, as a median
  elongated uterus, bilaterally formed, from which the genital ducts passed, probably as in Limulus,
  towards a mass of generative gland in the cephalic region, and not as in Scorpio or Thelyphonus,
  tailwards to the abdominal region.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Thyroid Gland of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>If we compare this mesosomatic region of Eurypterus with that of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the
  resemblance is most striking, and gives a meaning to the facial nerve which is in absolute
  accordance with the interpretation already given of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. In both
  cases the foremost respiratory or mesosomatic segment is double, the posterior lateral part alone
  bearing the branchi√¶, while the median and anterior part bore in the one animal the uterus and
  genital ducts, in the other the thyroid gland and ciliated grooves. We are driven, therefore, to
  the conclusion that this extraordinary and unique organ, the so-called thyroid gland of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, which exists only in the larval condition and is got rid of as soon as the adult
  sexual organs are formed, shows the very form and position of the uterus of this invertebrate
  ancestor of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. What, then, is the nature of the thyroid gland in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes?</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page193">{193}</span></div>

  <p>Throughout the vertebrate kingdom it is possible to compare the thyroid gland of one group of
  animals with that of another without coming across any very marked difference of structure right
  down to and including Petromyzon. When, however, we examine Ammoc&#x0153;tes, we find that the
  thyroid has suddenly become an organ of much more complicated structure, covering a much larger
  space, and bearing no resemblance to the thyroid glands of the higher forms. At transformation the
  thyroid of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is largely destroyed, and what remains of the gland in Petromyzon
  becomes limited to a few follicles resembling those of other fishes. The structure and position of
  this gland in Ammoc&#x0153;tes is so well known that it is unnecessary to describe it in detail.
  For the purpose, however, of making my points clear, I give in Fig. <a href="#fig80">80</a> the
  position and appearance of the thyroid gland (<i>Th.</i>) when the skin and underlying laminated
  layer has been removed by the action of hypochlorite of soda. On the one side the ventral somatic
  muscles have been removed to show the branchial cartilaginous basket-work.</p>

  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page195">{195}</span></div>

  <p>The series of transverse sections (1-6, Fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a>) show that we are dealing
  here with a central glandular chamber, C (Fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a> (6) and Fig. <a
  href="#fig82">82</a>), which opens by the thyroid duct (<i>Th. o.</i>) into the pharyngeal
  chamber, and is curled upon itself in its more posterior part. This central chamber divides,
  anteriorly to the thyroid orifice, into two portions, A, A&prime; (Fig. <a href="#fig82">82</a>),
  giving origin to two tubes, B, B&prime;, which lie close alongside of, and extend further back
  than, the posterior limit of the curled portion of the central chamber, C. The structure of the
  central chamber, C, and, therefore, of the separate coils, is given in both Schneider's and
  Dohrn's pictures, and is represented in Fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a> (6), which shows the peculiar
  arrangement and character of the glandular cells typical of this organ, and also the nature of the
  central cavity, with the arrangement of the ciliated epithelium. The structure of each of the
  lateral tubes, B, is different from that of the central chamber, in that only half the central
  chamber is present in them, as is seen by the comparison of the tube B with the tube C in Fig. <a
  href="#fig81">81</a> (5 and 6), so that we may look upon the central chamber, C, as formed of two
  tubes, similar in structure to the tubes B, which have come together to form a single chamber by
  the partial absorption of their walls, the remains of the wall being still visible as the septum,
  which partially divides the chamber, C, into halves.</p>

  <p>In the walls of each of these tubes is situated a continuous glandular line, the structure of
  the glandular elements being specially characterized by the length of the cells, by the large
  spherical nucleus situated at the very base of each cell, and by the way in which the cells form a
  wedge-shaped group, the thin points of all the wedge-shaped cells coming together so as to form a
  continuous line along the chamber wall. This free termination of the cells of the gland in the
  lumen of the chamber constitutes the whole method for the secretion of the gland; there is no
  duct, no alveolus, nothing but this free termination of the cells.</p>

  <p>Moreover, sections through the portion A, A&prime; (Fig. <a href="#fig82">82</a>) show that
  here, as in the central chamber, C, four of these glandular lines open into a common chamber, but
  they are not the same four as in the case of the central chamber, for if we name these glandular
  lines on the left side <i>a b, a&prime; b&prime;</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a>), and on the
  right side <i>c d, c&prime; d&prime;</i>, then the central chamber has opening into it the glands
  <i>a b, c d</i>, while the chambers of A and A&prime; have opening into them respectively <i>a b,
  a&prime; b&prime;</i>, and <i>c d, c&prime; d&prime;</i>. Further, the same series of sections
  shows that the glands <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are continuous with the glands <i>a&prime;</i> and
  <i>b&prime;</i> respectively across the apex of A, and similarly on the other side, so that the
  two glandular rows <i>a b</i> are continuous with the two glandular rows <i>a&prime; b&prime;</i>,
  and we see that the <span class="pagenum" id="page196">{196}</span>cavity of the portion A or
  A&prime; is formed by the bending over of the tube or horn, B or B&prime;, with the partial
  absorption of the septum so formed between the tube and its bent-over part. If, then, we uncoil
  the curled-up part of C, and separate the portion, B, on each side from the chamber, C, we see
  that the so-called thyroid of Ammoc&#x0153;tes may be represented as in Fig. <a
  href="#fig83">83</a>, <i>i.e.</i> it consists of a long, common chamber, C, which, for reasons
  apparent afterwards, I will call the <i>pal√¶o-hysteron</i>, which opens, by means of a large
  orifice, into the respiratory or pharyngeal chamber. The anterior end of this chamber terminates
  in two tubes, or horns, B, B&prime;, the structure of which shows that the median chamber, C, is
  the result of the amalgamation of two such tubes, and consequently in this chamber, or
  <i>pal√¶o-hysteron</i>, the glandular lines are symmetrically situated on each side.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Any explanation, then, of the thyroid gland of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, must <span class="pagenum"
  id="page197">{197}</span>take into account the clear evidence that it is composed of two tubes,
  which have in part fused together to form an elongated central chamber, in part remain as horns to
  that chamber, and that in its walls there exist lines of gland-cells of a striking and
  characteristic nature.</p>

  <p>Further, this central chamber, with its horns, is not a closed chamber, but is in communication
  with the pharyngeal or respiratory chamber by three ways. In the first place, the central chamber,
  as is well known, opens into the respiratory chamber by a funnel-shaped opening&mdash;the
  so-called thyroid duct (<i>Th. o.</i>). In the second place, there exist two ciliated grooves
  (<i>Ps. br.</i>, <i>Ps. br&prime;.</i>), the pseudo-branchial grooves of Dohrn, which have direct
  communication with the thyroid chamber. The manner in which these grooves communicate with the
  thyroid chamber has never, to my knowledge, been described previously to my description in the
  <i>Journal of Physiology and Anatomy</i>; it is very instructive, for, as I have there shown, each
  groove enters into the corresponding lateral horn, so that, in reality, there are three openings
  into the thyroid chamber or pal√¶o-hysteron&mdash;a median opening into the central chamber, and a
  separate opening into each lateral horn.</p>

  <p>The system of ciliated grooves on the inner ventral surface of the respiratory chamber of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes was originally described by Schneider as consisting of a single median groove,
  which extends from the opening of the thyroid to the posterior extremity of the branchial chamber,
  and a pair of grooves, or semi-canals, which, starting from the region of the thyroid orifice, run
  headwards and diverge from each other, becoming more and more lateral, and more and more dorsal,
  till they come together in the mid-dorsal pharyngeal line below the auditory capsules. The latter
  are the pseudo-branchial grooves of Dohrn, of which I have already spoken. Schneider looked upon
  the whole of this system as a single system, for he speaks of "a ciliated groove, which extends
  from the orifice of the stomach (<i>i.e.</i> anterior intestine) to the orifice of the thyroid,
  then divides into two, and runs forward right and left of the median ridge, etc." Dohrn rightly
  separates the median ciliated groove posterior to the thyroid orifice (seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig81">81</a> (6)) from the paired pseudo-branchial grooves; the former is a shallow
  depression which opens into the rim of the thyroid orifice, while the latter has a much more
  intimate connection with the thyroid gland itself.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page198">{198}</span></div>

  <p>A series of sections, such as is given in Fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a>, shows the relation of
  this pair of ciliated grooves to the thyroid better than any elaborate description. In the first
  place, it is clear that they remain separate up to their termination&mdash;they do not join in the
  middle line to open into the thyroid duct; in the second place, they are separate from the thyroid
  orifice&mdash;they do not terminate at the rim of the orifice, as is the case with the median
  groove just mentioned, but continue on each side on the wall of the thyroid duct (Fig. <a
  href="#fig81">81</a> (2)), gradually moving further and further away from the actual opening of
  the duct into the pharyngeal chamber. During the whole of their course on the wall of the
  funnel-shaped duct they retain the character of grooves, and are therefore open to the lumen of
  the duct. The direction of the groove (<i>Ps. br.</i>) shifts as it passes deeper and deeper
  towards the thyroid, until at last, as seen in Fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a> (3 and 4), it is
  continuous with the narrow diverticulum of the turned-down single part of the thyroid (B), or
  turned-down horn, as I have called it. In other words, the median chamber opens into the
  pharyngeal or respiratory chamber by a single large, funnel-shaped opening, and, in addition, the
  two ciliated grooves terminate in the lateral horns on each side, and only indirectly into the
  central chamber, owing to their being semi-canals, and not complete canals. If they were
  originally canals, and not grooves, then the thyroid of Ammoc&#x0153;tes would be derived from an
  organ composed of a large, common glandular chamber, which opened into the respiratory chamber by
  means of an extensive median orifice, and possessed anteriorly two horns, from each of which a
  canal or duct passed headwards to terminate somewhere in the region of the auditory capsule.</p>

  <p>Dohrn has pointed out that a somewhat similar structure and topographical arrangement is found
  in Amphioxus and the Tunicata, the gland-cells being here arranged along the hypobranchial groove
  to form the endostyle and not shut off to form a closed organ, as in the thyroid of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes. Dohrn concludes, in my opinion rightly, that the endostyle in the Tunicata and
  in Amphioxus represents the remnants of the more elaborate organ in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and that,
  therefore, in order to explain the meaning of these organs in the former animals, we must first
  find out their meaning in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. Dohrn, however, goes further than this; for just as he
  considers Amphioxus and the Tunicata to have arisen by degeneration from an Ammoc&#x0153;tes-like
  form, so he considers Ammoc&#x0153;tes to have arisen <span class="pagenum"
  id="page199">{199}</span>from a degenerated Selachian; therefore, in order to be logical, he ought
  to show that the thyroid of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is an intermediate downward step between the thyroid
  of Selachians and that of Amphioxus and the Tunicates. Here, it seems to me, his argument utterly
  breaks down; it is so clear that the thyroid of Petromyzon links on to that of the higher fishes,
  and that the Ammoc&#x0153;tes thyroid is so immeasurably more complicated and elaborate a
  structure than is that of Petromyzon, as to make it impossible to believe that the
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes thyroid has been derived by a process of degeneration from that of the Selachian.
  On the contrary, the manner in which it is eaten up at transformation and absolutely disappears in
  its original form is, like the other instances mentioned, strong evidence that we are dealing here
  with an ancestral organ, which is confined to the larval form, and disappears when the change to
  the higher adult condition takes place. Dohrn's evidence, then, points strongly to the conclusion
  that the starting-point of the thyroid gland in the vertebrate series is to be found in the
  thyroid of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, which has given rise, on the one hand, to the endostyle of Amphioxus
  and the Tunicata, and on the other, to the thyroid gland of Petromyzon and the rest of the
  Vertebrata.</p>

  <p>The evidence which I have just given of the intimate connection of the two pseudo-branchial
  grooves with the thyroid chamber shows, to my mind, clearly that Dohrn is right in supposing that
  morphologically these two grooves and the thyroid must be considered together. His explanation is
  that the whole system represents a modified pair of branchial segments distinct from those
  belonging to the VIIth and IXth nerves. The cavity of the thyroid and the pseudo-branchial grooves
  are, therefore, according to him, the remains of the gill-pouches of this fused pair of branchial
  segments, which no longer open to the surface, and the glandular tissue of the thyroid is derived
  from the modified gill-epithelium. This view of Dohrn's, which he has urged most strongly in
  various papers, is, I think, right in so far as the separateness of the thyroid segment is
  concerned, but is not right, and is not proven, in so far as concerns the view that the thyroid
  gland is a modified pair of gills.</p>

  <p>We may distinctly, on my view, look upon the thyroid segment, with its ciliated grooves and its
  covering plate of muco-cartilage, as a distinct paired segment, homologous with the branchial
  segments, without any necessity of deriving the thyroid gland from a pair of gills.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page200">{200}</span></div>

  <p>The evidence that such a median segment has been interpolated ventrally between the foremost
  pairs of branchial segments is remarkably clear, for the limits ventrally of the branchial
  segments are marked out on each side by the ventral border of the cartilaginous basket-work; and
  it is well known, as seen in Fig. <a href="#fig80">80</a>, that whereas this cartilaginous
  framework on the two sides meets together in the middle ventral line in the posterior branchial
  region, it diverges in the anterior region so as to form a tongue-shaped space between the
  branchial segments on the two sides. This space is covered over with a plate of muco-cartilage
  which bears on its inner surface the thyroid gland.</p>

  <div class="ac w40 fcenter sp2">

      and <i>X<sup>1</sup></i>-<i>X<sup>6</sup></i>, the Vagus Nerves.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In addition to this evidence that we are dealing here with a ventral tongue-like segment
  belonging to the facial nerve which is interpolated between the foremost branchial segments, we
  find the most striking fact that at transformation the whole of this muco-cartilaginous plate
  disappears, the remarkable thyroid gland of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page201">{201}</span>Ammoc&#x0153;tes is eaten up, and nothing is left except a small, totally
  different glandular mass; and now the cartilaginous basket-work meets together in the middle line
  in this region as well as in the more posterior region. In other words, the striking
  characteristic of transformation here is the destruction of this interpolated segment, and the
  resulting necessary drawing together ventrally of the branchial segments on each side.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Moreover, another most instructive piece of evidence pointing in the same direction is afforded
  by the behaviour of the ventral epithelial <span class="pagenum" id="page202">{202}</span>pits, as
  determined by Miss Alcock. Although there is no indication on the ventral surface of the skin of
  any difference between the anterior and posterior portions of the respiratory region, yet when the
  ventral rows of the epithelial pits supplied by each branchial nerve are mapped out, we see how
  the most anterior ones diverge more and more from the mid-ventral line, following out exactly the
  limits of the underlying muco-cartilaginous thyroid plate (Fig. <a href="#fig84">84</a>).</p>

  <p class="sp3">The whole evidence strongly leads to the conclusion that the thyroid portion of the
  facial segment was inserted as a median tongue between the foremost branchial segments on each
  side, and that, therefore, the whole facial segment, consisting as it does of a thyroid part and a
  hyoid or branchial part, may be represented as in Fig. 85, which is obtained by splitting an
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes longitudinally along the mid-dorsal line, so as to open out the pharyngeal
  chamber and expose the whole internal surface. The facial segment is marked out by shading lines,
  the glosso-pharyngeal and vagus segments and the last of the trigeminal segments being indicated
  faintly. The position of the thyroid gland is indicated by oblique lines, C being the curled
  portion.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Uterus of the Scorpion Group.</span></p>

  <p>Seeing how striking is the arrangement and the structure of the glandular tissue of this
  thyroid, how large the organ is and how absolutely it is confined to Ammoc&#x0153;tes,
  disappearing entirely as such at transformation, we may feel perfectly certain that a
  corresponding, probably very similar, organ existed in the invertebrate ancestor of the
  vertebrate; for the transformation process consists essentially of the discarding of invertebrate
  characteristics and the putting on of more vertebrate characters; also, so elaborate an organ
  cannot possibly have been evolved as a larval adaptation during the life of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. We
  may therefore assert with considerable confidence that the thyroid gland was the
  <i>pal√¶o-hysteron</i>, and was derived from the uterus of the ancient pal√¶ostracan forms. If,
  then, it be found that a glandular organ of this very peculiar structure and arrangement is
  characteristic of the uterus of any living member of the scorpion group, then the confidence of
  this assertion is greatly increased.</p>

  <p>In Limulus, as already stated, the genital ducts open separately <span class="pagenum"
  id="page203">{203}</span>on each side of the operculum, and do not combine to form a uterus; I
  have examined them and was unable to find any glandular structure at all resembling that of the
  thyroid gland of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. I then turned my attention to the organs of the scorpion, in
  which the two ducts have fused to form a single uterus.</p>

  <p>I there found that both in the male and in the female the genital ducts on each side terminate
  in a common chamber or uterus, which underlies the whole length of the operculum, and opens to the
  exterior in the middle line, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig76">76</a>. In transverse section, this
  uterus has the appearance shown in Fig. <a href="#fig86">86</a>, <i>i.e.</i> it is a large tube,
  evidently expansible, lined with a chitinous layer and epithelial cells belonging to the
  chitinogenous layer, except in two symmetrical places, where the uniformity of the uterine wall is
  interrupted by two large, remarkable glandular structures. The structure of these glands is better
  shown by means of sagittal sections. They are composed of very long, wedge-shaped cells, each of
  which possesses a large, round nucleus at the basal end of the cell (Fig. <a
  href="#fig87">87</a>). These cells are arranged in bundles of about eight to ten, which are
  separated from each other by connective tissue, the apex of each conical bundle being directed
  into the cavity of the uterus; where this brush-like termination of the cells reaches the surface,
  the chitinous layer is absent, so that this layer is, on surface view, seen (Fig. <a
  href="#fig88">88</a> (<i>b</i>)) to be pitted with round holes over that part of the internal
  surface of the uterus where these glands are situated. Each of these holes represents the
  termination of one of these cone-shaped wedges of cells. If the section is cut across at right
  angles to the axis of these cones, then its appearance is represented in Fig. <a
  href="#fig88">88</a> (<i>a</i>), and shows well the arrangement of the blocks of cells, separated
  from each other by connective tissue. When the section passes through the basal part of the cones,
  and only in that case, then the nuclei of the cells appear, often in considerable numbers in one
  section, as <span class="pagenum" id="page205">{205}</span>is seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig89">89</a>. In Fig. <a href="#fig88">88</a> the section shows at <i>b</i> the holes in
  the chitin in which the cones terminate, and then a series of layers of sections through the cones
  further and further away from their apices.</p>

  <p>These conical groups of long cells, represented in Fig. <a href="#fig87">87</a>, form on each
  side of the uterus a gland, which is continuous along its whole length, and thus forms a line of
  secreting surface on each side, just as in the corresponding arrangement of the glandular
  structures in the thyroid of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. This uterus and glandular arrangement is found in
  both sexes; the gland is, however, more developed in the male than in the female scorpion.</p>

  <p>The resemblance between the structure of the thyroid of Ammoc&#x0153;tes and the uterus of the

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>With respect to the first difference, the same difficulty is met <span class="pagenum"
  id="page206">{206}</span>with in the comparison of the ciliated lining of the tube in the central
  nervous system of vertebrates with the chitinous lining of the intestine in the arthropod. Such a
  difference does not seem to me either unlikely or unreasonable, seeing that cilia are found
  instead of chitin in the intestine of the primitive arthropod Peripatus. Also the worm-like
  ancestors of the arthropods almost certainly possessed a ciliated intestine. Finally, the
  researches of Hardy and McDougall on the intestine of Daphnia point directly to the presence of a
  ciliated rather than a chitinous epithelial lining of the intestine in this animal&mdash;all
  evidence pointing to the probability that in the ancient arthropod forms, derived as they were
  from the annelids, the intestine was originally ciliated and not chitinous. It is from such forms
  that I suppose vertebrates to have sprung, and not from forms like the living king-crabs,
  scorpions, Apus, Branchipus, etc. I only use them as illustrations, because they are the only
  living representatives of the great archaic group, from which the Crustacea, Arachnida, and
  Vertebrata all took origin.</p>

  <p>The second difference is more important, and is at first sight fatal to any comparison between
  the two organs. How is it possible to compare the uterus of the scorpion, which opens on the
  surface by an <i>external</i> genital opening, with the thyroid of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, which opens
  by an <i>internal</i> opening into the respiratory chamber? However close may be the histological
  resemblance of structure in the two cases, surely such a difference is too great to be accounted
  for.</p>

  <p>It is, however, to be remembered that the operculum of Scorpio covers only the terminal genital
  apparatus, and does not, therefore, resemble the operculum of the presumed ancestor of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, which, as already argued, must have resembled the operculum of Thelyphonus with
  its conjoint branchial and genital apparatus, rather than that of Scorpio. Before, therefore,
  making too sure of the insuperable character of this difficulty, we must examine the uterus of the
  Pedipalpi, and see the nature of its opening.</p>

  <p>The nature of the terminal genital organs in Thelyphonus has been described to some extent by
  Blanchard, and more recently by Tarnani. The ducts of the generative organs terminate, according
  to the latter observer, in the large uterus, which is found both in the male and female; he
  describes the walls of the uterus in the female as formed of elongated glandular epithelium, with
  a strongly-developed porous, chitinized intima. In the male, he says that the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page207">{207}</span>epithelium of the uterus masculinus and its processes is
  extraordinarily elongated, the chitin covering being thick. In these animals, then, the common
  chamber or uterus into which the genital ducts empty, which, like the corresponding chamber in the
  scorpion, occupies the middle region of the operculum, is a large and conspicuous organ. Further,
  and this is a most striking fact, the <i>uterus masculinus</i> does not open direct to the
  exterior, but into the genital cavity, "which lies above the uterus, so that the latter is
  situated between the lower wall of the genital cavity and the outer integument." The opening,
  therefore, of the uterus is not external but <i>internal</i>, into the large internal space known
  as the genital cavity. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 91, taken from Tarnani's paper, which
  represents a diagrammatic sagittal section through the exit of the male genital duct. Yet another
  most striking fact is described by Tarnani. This genital cavity is continuous with the pulmonary
  or gill cavities on each side, so that instead of a single opening for the genital products and
  one on each side for each gill-pouch, as would be the case if the arrangement was of the same kind
  as in the scorpion, there is a single large chamber, the genital chamber, common to both
  respiratory and genital organs.</p>

      <p><span class="sc">Fig. 91.&mdash;Sagittal Median Diagrammatic Section through the Operculum
      of the Male Thelyphonus.</span> (From <span class="sc">Tarnani</span>.)</p>
      <p class="sp0">The thick line is the operculum, composed of two segments, <i>I.</i> and
      <i>II.</i> <i>Ut. Masc.</i>, uterus masculinus; <i>Gen. Ch.</i>, genital chamber; <i>Int.
      Op.</i>, internal opening; <i>Ext. Op.</i>, external opening common to the genital and
      respiratory organs.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This genital chamber, according to Tarnani, opens to the exterior by a single median opening
  between the operculum and the succeeding segment; similarly, a communication from side to side
  exists between the second pair of gill-pouches. I have been able to examine <i>Hypoctonus
  formosus</i> and <i>Thelyphonus caudatus</i>, and in both cases, in both male and female, the
  opening to the exterior of the common chamber for respiration and for the genital products was
  <span class="pagenum" id="page208">{208}</span>not a single opening, as described by Tarnani in
  <i>Thelyphonus asperatus</i>, but on each side of the middle line, a round orifice closed by a
  lid, like the nest of the trapdoor spider, led into the common genital chamber (<i>Gen. Ch.</i>)
  into which both uterus and gills opened. In Fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a> I have endeavoured to
  represent the arrangement of the genital and respiratory organs in the male Thelyphonus according
  to Tarnani's and my own observations.</p>

  <p>If we may take Thelyphonus as a sample of the arrangement in those scorpions in which the
  operculum was fused with the first branchial appendage, among which must be included the old
  sea-scorpions, then it is most significant that their uterus should open internally into a cavity
  which was continuous with the respiratory cavity. Thus not only the structure of the gland, but
  also the arrangement of the internal opening into the respiratory, or, as it became later, the
  pharyngeal cavity, is in accordance with the suggestion that the thyroid of Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  represents the uterus of the extinct Eurypterus-like ancestor.</p>

  <p>Into this uterus the products of the generative organs were poured by means of the <i>vasa
  deferentia</i>, so that there was not a single median opening or duct in connection with it, but
  also two side openings, the terminations of the <i>vasa deferentia</i>. These are described by
  Tarnani in Thelyphonus as opening into the two horns of the uterus, which thus shows its bilateral
  character, although the body of the organ is median and single; these ducts then pass within the
  body of the animal, dorsal to the uterus, towards the testes or ovaries as the case may be, organs
  which are situated in these animals, as in other scorpions, in the abdomen, so that the direction
  of the ducts from the generative glands to the uterus is headwards. If, however, we examine the
  condition of affairs in Limulus, we find that the main mass of the generative material is
  cephalic, forming with the liver that dense glandular mass which is packed round the
  supra-&#x0153;sophageal and prosomatic ganglia, and round the stomach and muscles of the
  head-region. From this cephalic region the duct passes out on each side at the junction of the
  prosomatic and mesosomatic carapace to open separately on the posterior surface of the operculum,
  near the middle line, as is indicated in Fig. <a href="#fig75">75</a>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">We have, therefore, two distinct possible positions for the genital ducts among the
  group of extinct scorpion-like animals, the one from the cephalic region to the operculum, and the
  other from the abdominal region to the operculum.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page209">{209}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Generative Glands of Limulus and its Allies.</span></p>

  <p>The whole argument, so far, has in every case ended with the conclusion that the original
  scorpion-like form with which I have been comparing Ammoc&#x0153;tes resembled in many respects
  Limulus rather than the present-day scorpions, and therefore in the case also of the generative
  organs, with which the thyroid gland or pal√¶o-hysteron was in connection, it is more probable that
  they were cephalic in position rather than abdominal. If this were so, then the duct on each side,
  starting from the median ventral uterus, would take a lateral and dorsal course to reach the huge
  mass of generative gland lying within the prosomatic carapace, just as I have represented in the
  figure of Eurypterus (Fig. <a href="#fig79">79</a>), a course which would take much the same
  direction as the ciliated groove in Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>We ought, therefore, on this supposition, to expect to find the remains of the invertebrate
  generative tissue, the ducts of which terminated in the thyroid, in the head-region, and not in
  the abdomen.</p>

  <p>Upon removal of the prosomatic carapace of Limulus, a large brownish glandular-looking mass is
  seen, in which, if it happens to be a female, masses of ova are very conspicuous. This mass is
  composed of two separate glands, the generative glands and the hepatico-pancreatic
  glands&mdash;the so-called liver&mdash;and surrounds closely the central nervous system and the
  alimentary canal. From the generative glands proceed the genital ducts to terminate on the
  posterior surface of the operculum. From the liver ducts pass to the pyloric end of the cephalic
  stomach, and carry the fluid by means of which the food is digested, for, in all these animals,
  the active digesting juices are formed in the so-called liver, and not in the cells of the stomach
  or intestine.</p>

  <p>It is a very striking fact that the brain of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is much too small for the
  brain-case, and that the space between brain and brain-case is filled up with a very peculiar
  glandular-looking tissue, which is found in Ammoc&#x0153;tes and not elsewhere. Further, it is
  also striking that in the brain of Ammoc&#x0153;tes there should still exist the remains of a tube
  extending from the IVth ventricle to the surface at the <i>conus post-commissuralis</i>, which can
  actually be traced right into this tissue on the outside of the brain (see Fig. <a
  href="#fig13">13</a>, <i>a-e</i>, Pl. XXVI., in my paper in the <i>Quarterly Journal of
  Microscopical Science</i>). <span class="pagenum" id="page210">{210}</span>This, in my opinion, is
  the last remnant of one of the old liver-ducts which extended from the original stomach and
  intestine into the cephalic liver-mass. This glandular-looking material is shown surrounding the
  pineal eye and its nerve, in Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>, also in Fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a>,
  and separately in Fig. <a href="#fig92">92</a>. It is composed of large cells, with a badly
  staining nucleus, closely packed together with lines of pigment here and there between the cells;
  this pigment is especially congregated at the spot where the so-called liver-duct loses itself in
  this tissue. The protoplasm in these large cells does not stain well, and with osmic acid gives no
  sign of fat, so that Ahlborn's description of this tissue as a peculiar arachnoideal fat-tissue is
  not true; peculiar it certainly is, but fatty it is not.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 92.&mdash;Drawing of the Tissue which surrounds the Brain
      of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This tissue has been largely described as a peculiar kind of connective tissue, which is there
  as packing material, for the purpose of steadying a brain too small for its case. On the face of
  it such an explanation is unscientific; certainly for all those who really believe in evolution,
  it is out of the question to suppose that a brain-case has been laid down in the first instance
  too large for the brain, in order to provide room for a subsequent increase of brain; just as it
  is out of the question to suppose that the nervous system was laid down originally as an
  epithelial tube in order to provide for the further development of the nervous system by the
  conversion of more and more of that tube into nervous matter. Yet this latter proposition has been
  seriously put forward by professed believers in evolution and in natural selection.</p>

  <p>This tissue bears no resemblance whatever to any form of connective tissue, either fatty or
  otherwise. By every test this tissue tells as plainly as possible that it is a vestige of some
  former organ, presumably glandular, which existed in that position; that it is not there as
  packing material because the brain happened to be too small for its case, but that, on the
  contrary, the brain is too small for its case, because the case, when it was formed, included this
  organ as well as the brain; in other words, this tissue <span class="pagenum"
  id="page211">{211}</span>is there because it is the remnant of the great glandular mass which so
  closely surrounds the brain and alimentary canal in animals such as Limulus. In my paper in the
  <i>Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science</i>, in which I was comparing the tube of the
  vertebrate nervous system with the alimentary canal of the invertebrate, I spoke of this tissue as
  being the remnant of the invertebrate liver. At the same time the whole point of my argument was
  that the glandular material surrounding the brain of Limulus was made up of two glands&mdash;liver
  and generative gland&mdash;so that this tissue might be the remnant of either one or the other, or
  both. All I desired, at that time, was to point out the glandular appearance of this so-called
  packing tissue, which surrounded the brain-region of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, in connection with the fact
  that the brain and alimentary canal of Limulus were closely surrounded with a glandular mass
  composed partly of liver, partly of the generative gland. At present, I think these large cells
  found round the brain in Ammoc&#x0153;tes are much more likely to be the remnant of the generative
  gland than of the liver; the size of the cells and their arrangement recalls Owen's picture of the
  generative gland in Limulus, and seeing how important all generative glands are in their capacity
  of internal secreting glands, apart entirely from the extrusion of the ripe generative products,
  and how unimportant is an hepato-pancreas when the alimentary canal is closed, it is much more
  likely that of the two glands the former would persist longer than the latter. It may be that all
  that is left of the old hepato-pancreas consists of the pigment so markedly found in between these
  cells, especially at the place where the old liver-duct reaches the surface of the brain; just as
  the only remnant of the two pineal eyes in the higher vertebrates is the remains of the pigment,
  known as brain-sand, which still exists in the pineal gland of even the highest vertebrate. This,
  however, is a mere speculation of no importance. What is important is the recognition of this
  tissue round the brain as the remnant of the glandular mass round the brain of animals such as
  Limulus. Still further confirmation of the truth of this comparison will be given when the origin
  of the auditory organ comes up for discussion.</p>

  <p>I conclude, therefore, from the evidence of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, that the generative glands in the
  ancestral form were situated largely in the cephalic region, and suggest that the course and
  direction of the ciliated pseudo-branchial grooves on each side indicate the direction of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page212">{212}</span>original opercular ducts by which the generative
  products were conveyed to the uterine chamber, i.e. to the chamber of the thyroid gland, and
  thence to the common genital and respiratory cavity, and so to the exterior.</p>

  <p>It is easy to picture the sequence of events. First, the generative glands, chiefly confined to
  the cephalic region, communicating with the exterior by separate ducts on the inner surface of the
  operculum as in Limulus. Then, in connection with the viviparous habit, these two oviducts fused
  together to form a single chamber, covered by the operculum, which opened out to the exterior by a
  single opening as in Scorpio: or, in forms such as Eurypterus, in which the operculum had
  amalgamated with the first branchial appendage and possessed a long, tongue-like ventral
  projection, the amalgamated ducts formed a long uterine chamber which opened internally into the
  genital chamber&mdash;a chamber which, as in Thelyphonus, was common with that of the two
  gill-chambers, while at the same time the genital ducts from the cephalic generative material
  opened into two uterine horns which arose from the anterior part of the uterus, as in
  Thelyphonus.</p>

  <p>Such an arrangement would lead directly to the condition found in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, if the
  generative material around the brain lost its function, owing to a new exit for generative
  products being formed in the posterior part of the body. The connection of the genital duct with
  this cephalic gland being then closed and cut off by the brain-case, the position of the oviducts
  would still be shown by the ciliated grooves opening into the folded-down thyroid tube,
  <i>i.e.</i> the folded-down horns of the uterus; the uterus itself would remain as the main body
  of the thyroid and still open by a conspicuous orifice into the common respiratory chamber. Next,
  in the degeneration process, we may suppose that not only the oviducts opened out to form the
  ciliated groove, but that the uterine chamber itself also opened out, and thus formed the
  endostyle of Amphioxus and of the Tunicata.</p>

  <p>It might seem at first sight improbable that a closed tube should become an open groove,
  although the reverse phenomenon is common enough; the difficulty, however, is clearly not
  considered great, for it is precisely what Dohrn imagines to have taken place in the conversion of
  the thyroid of Ammoc&#x0153;tes into the endostyle of Amphioxus and the Tunicata; it is only
  carrying on the same idea a stage further to see in the open, ciliated groove of Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  the remains of the closed genital duct of Limulus and its allies.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page213">{213}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">Such is the conclusion to which the study of the thyroid gland in Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  seems to me to lead, and one cannot help wondering why such an unused and rudimentary organ should
  have remained after its original function had gone. Is it possible to find out its function in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes?</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Function of the Thyroid Gland in Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>The thyroid gland has been supposed to secrete mucus into the respiratory chamber for the
  purpose of entangling the particles of food, and so aiding in digestion. I see no sign of any such
  function; neither by the thionin method, nor by any other test, have Miss Alcock and myself ever
  been able to see any trace of mucous secretion in the thyroid, and, indeed, the thyroid duct is
  always remarkably free from any sign of any secretion whatever. Not only is there no evidence of
  any mucous secretion in the thyroid of the fully developed Ammoc&#x0153;tes, but also no necessity
  for such secretion from Dohrn's point of view, for so copious a supply of mucus is poured out by
  the glands of the branchi√¶, along the whole pharyngeal tract, especially from the cells of the
  foremost or hyoid gills, as to mix up with the food as thoroughly as can possibly be needed.
  Further, too, the ciliated pharyngeal bands described by Schneider are amply sufficient to move
  this mixed mass along in the way required by Dohrn. Finally, the evidence given by Miss Alcock is
  absolutely against the view that the thyroid takes any part in the process of digestion, while, on
  the other hand, her evidence directly favours the view that these glandular <i>branchial</i>
  mucus-secreting cells play a most important part in the digestive process.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig93">93</a>, A is a representation of the respiratory tissue of a normal
  gill; B is the corresponding portion of the first or hyoid gill, in which, as is seen, the whole
  of the respiratory epithelium is converted into gland-tissue of the nature of mucous cells.</p>

  <p>To sum up, the evidence is clear and conclusive that the Ammoc&#x0153;tes possesses in its
  pharyngeal chamber mucus-secreting glands, which take an active part in the digestive process,
  which do not in the least resemble either in structure or arrangement the remarkable cells of the
  thyroid gland, and that the experimental evidence that the latter cells either secrete mucus or
  take any part in digestion is so far absolutely negative. It is, of course, possible, that they
  <span class="pagenum" id="page214">{214}</span>may contain mucin in the younger developmental
  stages, and therefore possible that they might at that stage secrete it; they certainly, however,
  show no sign of doing so in their more adult condition, and cannot be compared in the very
  faintest degree to the glandular cells of the pharyngeal region. It is also perfectly possible for
  gland-cells belonging to a retrograde organ to become mucus-secreting, and so to give rise to the
  cells of Amphioxus and the Tunicata.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>If, then, these cells were not retained for digestive purposes, what was their function? To
  answer this question we must first know the function of the corresponding gland-cells in the
  uterus of the scorpion, which undoubtedly secreted into the cavity of the uterus and took some
  part in connection with the generative act, and certainly not with digestion. What the function of
  these cells is or in what way they act I am unable at present to say. I can only suppose that the
  reason why the thyroid gland has persisted throughout the vertebrate kingdom, after the generative
  tissues had found a new outlet for their products in the body-cavity of the posterior region, is
  because it possessed some important function in addition to that connected with the exit of the
  products of the generative organs; a function which was essential to the well-being, or even to
  the life of the animal. We do not know its function in the scorpion, or the nature of its
  secretion in that animal. We know only that physiology at the present day has demonstrated clearly
  that the actual external secretion of a gland may be by no means its most important function; in
  addition, glands possess what is called an internal secretion, viz. a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page215">{215}</span>secretion into the blood and lymph, and this latter secretion may be of
  the most vital importance. Now, the striking fact forces itself prominently forward, that the
  thyroid gland of the higher vertebrates is the most conspicuous example of the importance of such
  internal secretion. Here, although ductless, we have a gland which cannot be removed without fatal
  consequences. Here, in the importance of its internal secretion, we have a reason for the
  continued existence of this organ; an organ which remains much the same throughout the Vertebrata
  down to and including Petromyzon, but, as is seen at transformation, is all that remains of the
  more elaborate, more extensive organ of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. Surely we may argue that it is this
  second function which has led to the persistence of the thyroid, and that its original form,
  without its original function, is seen in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, because that is a larval form, and not
  a fully-developed animal. As soon as the generative organs of Petromyzon are developed at
  transformation, all trace of its connection with a genital duct vanishes, and presumably its
  internal secretory function alone remains.</p>

  <p>Yet, strange to say, a mysterious connection continues to exist between the thyroid gland and
  the generative organs, even up to the highest vertebrate. That the thyroid gland, situated as it
  is in the neck, should have any sympathy with sexual functions if it was originally a gland
  concerned with digestion is, to say the least of it, extremely unlikely, but, on the contrary,
  likely enough if it originated from a glandular organ in connection with the sexual organs of the
  pal√¶ostracan ancestor of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Freund has shown, and shown conclusively, that there is an intimate connection
  between the condition of the thyroid gland and the state of the sexual organs, not only in human
  beings, but also in numerous animals, such as dogs, sheep, goats, pigs, and deer. He points out
  that the swelling of the gland, which occurs in consequence of sexual excitement (a fact mentioned
  both in folk-lore tales and in poetical literature), and also the swelling at the time of puberty,
  may both lead to a true goitrous enlargement; that most of the permanent goitres commence during a
  menstrual period; that during pregnancy swelling of the thyroid is almost universal, and may
  become so extreme as to threaten suffocation, or even cause death; that the period of puberty and
  the climacteric period are the two maximal periods for the onset of goitre, and that exophthalmic
  goitre especially is associated with a special disease connected with the uterus.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page216">{216}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>Step by step in the preceding chapters the evidence is accumulating in favour of the origin
    of vertebrates from a member of the pal√¶ostracan group. In a continuously complete and
    harmonious manner the evidence has throughout been most convincing when the vertebrate chosen
    for the purpose of my arguments has been Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>
    <p>So many fixed points have been firmly established as to enable us to proceed further with
    very great confidence, in the full expectation of being able ultimately to homologize the
    Vertebrata with the Pal√¶ostraca even to minute details.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most striking and unexpected result of such a comparison is the discovery that
    the thyroid gland is derived from the uterus of the pal√¶ostracan ancestor. Yet so clear is the
    evidence that it is difficult to see how the homology can be denied.</p>
    <p>In the one animal (Pal√¶ostraca) the foremost pair of mesosomatic appendages forms the
    operculum, which always bears the terminal generative organs and is fused in the middle line. In
    many forms, essentially in Eurypterus and the ancient sea-scorpions, the operculum was composed
    of two segments fused together: an anterior one which carried the uterus, and a posterior one
    which carried the first pair of branchi√¶.</p>
    <p>In the other animal (Ammoc&#x0153;tes) the foremost segments of the mesosomatic or
    respiratory region, immediately in front of the glossopharyngeal segments, are supplied by the
    facial nerve, and are markedly different from those supplied by the vagus and glossopharyngeal,
    for the facial supplies two segments fused together; the anterior one, the thyroid segment,
    carrying the thyroid gland, the posterior one, the hyoid segment, carrying the first pair of
    branchi√¶.</p>
    <p>Just as in Eurypterus the fused segment, carrying the uterus on its internal surface, forms a
    long median tongue which separates the most anterior branchial segments on each side, so also
    the fused segment carrying the thyroid forms in Ammoc&#x0153;tes a long median tongue, which
    separates the most anterior branchial segments on each side.</p>
    <p>Finally, and this is the most conclusive evidence of all, this thyroid gland of
    Ammoc&#x0153;tes is totally unlike that of any of the higher vertebrates, and, indeed, of the
    adult form Petromyzon itself, but it forms an elaborate complicated organ, which is directly
    comparable with the uterus and genital ducts of animals such as scorpions. Not only is such a
    comparison valid with respect to its shape, but also with respect to its structure, which is
    absolutely unique among vertebrates, and very different to that of any other vertebrate gland,
    but resembles in a striking manner a glandular structure found in the uterus, both of male and
    female scorpions.</p>
    <p>The generative glands in Limulus, together with the liver-glands, form a large glandular
    mass, situated in the head-region closely surrounding the central nervous system, so that the
    genital ducts pass from the head-region tailwards to the operculum. In the scorpion they lie in
    the abdominal region, so that their ducts pass headwards to the operculum.</p>
    <p>Probably in the Pal√¶ostraca the generative mass was situated in the cephalic region as in
    Limulus, and it is probable that the remnant of it still exists in <span class="pagenum"
    id="page217">{217}</span>Ammoc&#x0153;tes in the shape of the peculiar large cells packed
    together, with pigment masses in between them, which form such a characteristic feature of the
    glandular-looking material, which fills up the space between the cranial walls and the central
    nervous system.</p>
    <p>Finally, the relationship which has been known from time immemorial to exist between the
    sexual organs and the thyroid in man and other animals, and has hitherto been a mystery without
    any explanation, may possibly be the last reminiscence of a time when the thyroid glands were

  </div>

  <p>In the last chapter I finished the evidence given by the consideration of the mesosomatic or
  opisthotic nerves, and the segments they supplied. The evidence is strongly in accordance with
  that of previous chapters, and not only confirms the conclusion that vertebrates arose from some
  member of the Pal√¶ostraca, but helps still further to delimit the nature of that member. It is
  almost startling to see how the hypothesis put forward in the second chapter, suggested by the
  consideration of the nature of the vertebrate central nervous system and of the geological record,
  has received stronger and stronger confirmation from the consideration of the vertebrate optic
  apparatus, the vertebrate skeleton, the respiratory apparatus, and, finally, the thyroid gland.
  All fit naturally into a harmonious whole, and give a feeling of confidence that a similar harmony
  will be found upon consideration of the rest of the vertebrate organs.</p>

  <p>Following naturally upon the segments supplied by the opisthotic (mesosomatic) cranial nerves,
  we ought to consider now the segments supplied by the pro-otic (prosomatic) cranial nerves, i.e.
  the segments belonging to the trigeminal nerve-group in the vertebrate, and in the invertebrate
  the segments of the prosoma with their characteristic appendages. There are, however, in all
  vertebrates in this foremost cranial region, in addition to the optic nerves, two other
  well-marked nerves of special sense, the olfactory and the auditory. Of these, the former are in
  the same class as the optic nerves, for they arise <span class="pagenum"
  id="page219">{219}</span>in the vertebrate from the supra-infundibular nerve-mass, and in the
  invertebrate from the supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia. The latter arise in the vertebrate from the
  infra-infundibular nerve-mass, and, as the name implies, are situated in the region where the
  pro-otic nerves are contiguous to the opisthotic, <i>i.e.</i> at the junction of the prosomatic
  and mesosomatic nerve-regions.</p>

  <p>The chapter dealing with the evidence given by the olfactory nerves and the olfactory apparatus
  ought logically to have followed immediately upon the one dealing with the optic apparatus, seeing
  that both these special sense-nerves belong to the supra-infundibular segments in the vertebrate
  and to the supra-&#x0153;sophageal in the invertebrate.</p>

  <p class="sp5">I did not deal with them in that logical sequence because it was necessary for
  their understanding to introduce first the conception of modified appendages as important factors
  in any consideration of vertebrate segments; a conception which followed naturally after the
  evidence afforded by the skeleton in Chapter III., and by the branchial segments in Chapter IV.
  So, too, now, although the discussion of the prosomatic segmentation ought logically to follow
  immediately on that of the mesosomatic segmentation, I have determined to devote this chapter to
  the evidence of the olfactory organs, because the arguments as to the segments belonging to the
  trigeminal nerve-group are so much easier to understand if the position of the olfactory apparatus
  is first made clear.</p>

  <p>In all vertebrates the nose is double and opens into the pharynx, until we descend to the
  fishes, where the whole group Pisces has been divided into two subsidiary groups, Monorhin√¶ and
  Amphirhin√¶, according as they possess a median unpaired olfactory opening, or a paired opening.
  The Monorhin√¶ include only the Cyclostomata&mdash;the lampreys and hag-fishes.</p>

  <p>In the lampreys the single olfactory tube ends blindly, while in the hag-fishes it opens into
  the pharynx. In the lamprey, both in Petromyzon and Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the opening of this nasal
  tube is a conspicuous object on the dorsal surface of the head in front of the transparent spot
  which indicates the position of the right median eye. It is especially significant, as showing the
  primitive nature of this median olfactory passage, that a perfectly similar opening in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page220">{220}</span>same position is always found in the dorsal head-shields
  of all the Cephalaspid√¶ and Tremataspid√¶, as will be explained more fully in Chapter X.</p>

  <p>All the evidence points to the conclusion that the olfactory apparatus of the vertebrate
  originated as a single median tube, containing the special olfactory sense-epithelium, which,
  although median and single, was innervated by the olfactory nerve of each side. The external
  opening of this tube in the lamprey is dorsal. How does it terminate ventrally?</p>

  <p>The ventral termination of this tube is most instructive and suggestive. It terminates blindly
  at the very spot where the infundibular tube terminates blindly and the notochord ends. After
  transformation, when the Ammoc&#x0153;te becomes the Petromyzon, the tube still ends blindly, and
  does not open into the pharynx as in Myxine; it, however, no longer terminates at the
  infundibulum, but extends beyond it towards the pharynx.</p>

  <p>This position of the nasal tube suggests that it may originally have opened into the tube of
  the central nervous system by way of the infundibular tube. This suggestion is greatly enhanced in
  value by the fact that in the larval Amphioxus the tube of the central nervous system is open to
  the exterior, its opening being known as the anterior neuropore, and this anterior neuropore is
  situated at the base of a pit, known as the olfactory pit because it is supposed to represent the
  olfactory organ of other fishes.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Following the same lines of argument as in previous chapters, this suggestion
  indicates that the special olfactory organs of the invertebrate ancestor of the vertebrates
  consisted of a single median olfactory tube or passage, which led directly into the
  &#x0153;sophagus and was innervated, though single and median, by a pair of olfactory nerves which
  arose from the supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia. Let us see what is the nature of the olfactory
  organs among arthropods, and whether such a suggestion possesses any probability.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Olfactory Organs of the Scorpion Group.</span></p>

  <p>At first sight the answer appears to be distinctly adverse, for it is well known that in all
  the Insecta, Crustacea, and the large majority of Arthropoda, the first pair of antenn√¶, often
  called the antennules, are olfactory in function, and these are free-moving, bilaterally <span
  class="pagenum" id="page221">{221}</span>situated, independent appendages. Still, even here there
  is the striking fact that the nerves of these olfactory organs always arise from the
  supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, although those to the second pair of antenn√¶ arise from the
  infra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, just as the olfactory nerves of the vertebrate arise from the
  supra-infundibular brain-mass. Not only is there this similarity of position, but also a
  similarity of structure in the olfactive lobes of the brain itself of so striking a character as
  to cause Bellonci to sum up his investigations as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The structure and connections of the olfactive lobes present the same fundamental plan in the
  higher arthropods and in the vertebrates. In the one, as in the other, the olfactory fibres form,
  with the connecting fibres of the olfactory lobes, a fine meshwork, which, consisting as it does
  of separate groups, may each one be called an olfactory glomerulus."</p>

  <p>He attributes this remarkable resemblance to a physiological necessity that similarity of
  function necessitates similarity of structure, for he considers it out of the question to suppose
  any near relationship between arthropods and vertebrates.</p>

  <p>Truly an interesting remark, with the one fallacy that relationship is out of the question.</p>

  <p>The evidence so far has consistently pointed to some member of the pal√¶ostracan group as the
  ancestor of the vertebrates&mdash;a group which had affinities both to the crustaceans and the
  arachnids; indeed, many of its members resembled scorpions much more than they resemble
  crustaceans. The olfactory organs of the scorpions and their allies are, therefore, more likely
  than any others to give a clue to the position of the desired olfactory organs. In these animals
  and their allies paired olfactory antenn√¶ are not present, either in the living land-forms or the
  extinct sea-scorpions, for all the antenn√¶-like, frequently chelate, appendages seen in
  Pterygotus, etc. (Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a>), represent the chelicer√¶, and correspond, therefore,
  to the second pair of antenn√¶ in the crustaceans.</p>

  <p>What, then, represents the olfactory antenn√¶ in the scorpions? The answer to this question has
  been given by Croneberg, and very striking it is. The two olfactory antenn√¶ of the crustacean have
  combined together to form a hollow tube at the base of which the mouth of the animal is situated,
  so that the food passes along this olfactory passage before it reaches the mouth. This organ is
  often called after Latreille, the camerostome, sometimes the rostrum; it is naturally median in
  position and appears, therefore, to be an unpaired organ; its paired <span class="pagenum"
  id="page222">{222}</span>character is, of course, evident enough, for it is innervated by a pair
  of nerves, and these nerves, as ought to be the case, arise from the supra-&#x0153;sophageal
  ganglia. In Galeodes it is a conspicuously paired antenn√¶-like organ (Fig. <a
  href="#fig94">94</a>).</p>

  <p>Croneberg has also shown that this rostrum, or camerostome, arises embryologically as a pair of
  appendages similar to the other appendages. This last observation of Croneberg has been confirmed
  by Brauer in 1894, who describes the origin of the upper lip, as he calls it, in very similar
  terms, without, however, referring to Croneberg's paper. Croneberg further shows that this
  foremost pair of antenn√¶ not only forms the so-called upper lip or camerostome, but also a lower
  lip, for from the basal part of the camerostome there projects on each side of the pharynx a
  dependent accessory portion, which in some cases fuses in the middle line, and forms, as it were,
  a lower lip. The entosclerite belonging to this dependent portion is apparently the post-oral
  entosclerite of Lankester and Miss Beck.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>At the base of the tubular passage formed by this modified first pair of antenn√¶ the true mouth
  is found opening directly into the dilated pharynx, the muscles of which enable the act of suction
  to be carried out. The narrow &#x0153;sophagus leads out from the pharynx and is completely
  surrounded by the supra- and infra-&#x0153;sophageal nerve masses.</p>

  <p>Huxley also describes the mouth of the scorpion in precisely the same position (<i>cf. o</i>,
  Fig. <a href="#fig96">96</a>).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page223">{223}</span></div>

  <p>In order to convey to my readers the antenn√¶-like character of the camerostome in Galeodes
  (Fig. <a href="#fig101">101</a>), and its position, I give a figure (Fig. <a href="#fig94">94</a>)
  of the organ from its dorsal aspect, after removal of the chelicer√¶ and their muscles. A side view
  of the same organ is given in Fig. <a href="#fig95">95</a> to show the feathered termination of
  the camerostome, and the position of the dependent accessory portion (<i>l.l.</i>) (Croneberg's
  'untere Anhang') with its single long antenna-like feather. In both figures the alimentary canal
  (<i>al.</i>) is seen issuing from the conjoined supra- and infra-&#x0153;sophageal mass.</p>

  <p>As is seen in the figures, the bilateral character of the rostrum, as Croneberg calls it, is
  apparent not only in its feathered extremity but also in its chitinous covering, the softer median
  dorsal part (left white in figure) being bounded by two lateral plates of hard chitin, which meet
  in the middle line near the extremity of the organ. In all the members of the scorpion group, as
  is clearly shown in Croneberg's figures, the rostrum or camerostome is built up on the same plan
  as in Galeodes, though the antenna-like character may not be so evident.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>When we consider that the first pair of antenn√¶ in the crustaceans are olfactory in function,
  Croneberg's observations amount to this&mdash;</p>

  <p>In the arachnids and their allies the first pair of antenn√¶ form a pre-oral passage or tube,
  olfactory in function; the small mouth, which opens directly into the pharynx, being situated at
  the end of this olfactory passage.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page224">{224}</span></div>

  <p>Croneberg's observations and conclusions are distinctly of very great importance in bringing
  the arachnids into line with the crustaceans, and it is therefore most surprising that they are
  absolutely ignored by Lankester and Miss Beck in their paper published in 1883, in which Latreille
  only is mentioned with respect to this organ, and his term "camerostome," or upper lip, is used
  throughout, in accordance with the terminology in Lankester's previous paper. That this organ is
  not only a movable lip or tongue, but essentially a sense-organ, almost certainly of smell and
  taste, as follows from Croneberg's conclusions, is shown by the series of sections which I have
  made through a number of young Thelyphonus (Fig. <a href="#fig102">102</a>).</p>

  <div class="ac w50 fcenter sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I give in Fig. <a href="#fig96">96</a> a sagittal median section through the head-end of the
  animal, which shows clearly the nature of Croneberg's conception. At the front end of the body is
  seen the median eye (<i>ce.</i>), <i>o</i> is the mouth, <i>Ph.</i> the pharynx, <i>&#x0153;s.</i>
  the narrow &#x0153;sophagus, compressed between the supra-&#x0153;sophageal (<i>supr.
  &#x0153;s.</i>) and infra-&#x0153;sophageal (<i>infr. &#x0153;s.</i>) brain mass, which opens into
  the large alimentary canal (<i>Al.</i>); <i>Olf. pass.</i> is the olfactory passage to the mouth,
  lined with thick-set, very fine hairs, which spring from the hypostome (<i>Hyp.</i>) as well as
  from the large conspicuous camerostome (<i>Cam.</i>), which limits this tube anteriorly. The space
  between the camerostome and the median eye is filled up by the massive chelicer√¶, which are not
  shown in this section, as they begin to appear in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page225">{225}</span>sections on each side of the median one. The muscles of the pharynx and
  the muscles of the camerostome are attached to the pre-oral entosclerite (<i>pr. ent.</i>). The
  post-oral entosclerite is shown in section as <i>post. ent.</i> The dorsal blood-vessel, or heart,
  is indicated at <i>H.</i></p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig97">97</a> I give a transverse section through another specimen of the
  same litter, to show the nature of this olfactory tube when cut across. Both sections show most
  clearly that we are dealing here with an elaborate sense-organ, the surface of which is partly
  covered with very fine long hairs, partly, as is seen in the figure, is composed of long,
  separate, closely-set sense-rods (<i>bat.</i>), well protected by the long hairs which project on
  every side in front of them, which recall to mind Bellonci's figure of the 'batonnets olfactives'
  on the antenn√¶ of Sph√¶roma. Finally, we have the observation of Blanchard quoted by Huxley, to the
  effect that this camerostome is innervated by nerves from the supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia
  which are clearly bilateral, seeing that they arise from the ganglion on each side and then unite
  to pass into the camerostome; in other words, paired olfactory nerves from the
  supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia.</p>

  <p>These facts demonstrate with wonderful clearness that in one group of the Arthropoda the
  olfactory antenn√¶ have been so modified as to form an olfactory tube or passage, which leads
  directly into the mouth and so to the &#x0153;sophagus of the animal, and, strikingly enough, this
  group, the Arachnida, is the very one to which the scorpions belong.</p>

  <p class="sp3">If for any cause the mouth <i>o</i> in Fig. <a href="#fig96">96</a> were to be
  closed, then the olfactory tube (<i>olf. pass.</i>) might still remain, owing to its importance as
  the organ of smell, and the olfactory tube would terminate blindly at the very spot where the
  corresponding tube does terminate in the vertebrate, according to the theory put forward in this
  book.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Olfactory Tube of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>In all cases where there is similarity of topographical position in the organs of the
  vertebrate and arthropod we may expect also to find similarity of structure. At first sight it
  would appear as though such similarity fails us here, for a cross-section of the olfactory tube in
  Petromyzon represents an elaborate organ such as is shown in Fig. 98, very different in appearance
  to the section across the olfactory passage of a young Thelyphonus given in Fig. <a

  <p>As is seen, it is difficult to see any connection between these folds of olfactory epithelium
  and the simple tube of the scorpion. But in the nose, as in all other parts of the head-region of
  the lamprey, remarkable changes take place at transformation, and examination of the same tube in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes demonstrates that the elaborate structure of the adult olfactory organ is
  actually derived from a much simpler form of organ, represented in Fig. <a href="#fig99">99</a>.
  Here, in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the section is no longer strikingly different from that of the
  Thelyphonus organ, but, instead, most strikingly similar to it. Thus, again, it is shown that this
  larval form of the lamprey gives more valuable information as to vertebrate ancestry than all the
  rest of the vertebrates put together.</p>

  <div class="ac w40 fcenter sp2">

      <p class="sp0"><i>cart.</i>, nasal cartilage.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Still, even now the similarity between the two organs is not complete, for the tube in the
  lamprey opens on to the exterior on the dorsal surface of the head, while in the scorpion tribe it
  is situated ventrally, being the passage to the mouth and alimentary canal. In accordance with
  this there is no sign of any opening on the dorsal carapace of any of the extinct sea-scorpions or
  of the living land-scorpions, such as is so universally found in the cephalaspids, tremataspids,
  and lampreys. Here is a discrepancy of an apparently serious character, yet so wonderfully does
  the development of the individual recapitulate the development of the race, that this very
  discrepancy becomes converted into a triumphant vindication of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page228">{228}</span>correctness of the theory advocated in this book, as soon as we turn our
  attention to the development of this nasal tube in the lamprey.</p>

  <p>We must always remember not only the great importance of a larval stage for the unriddling of
  problems of ancestry, but also the great advantage of being able to follow more favourably any
  clues as to past history afforded by the development of the larva itself, owing to the greater
  slowness in the development of the larva than of the embryo. Such a clue is especially well marked
  in the course of development of Ammoc&#x0153;tes according to Kupffer's researches, for he finds
  that when the young Ammoc&#x0153;tes is from 5 to 7 mm. in length, some time after it has left the
  egg, when it is living a free larval life, a remarkable series of changes takes place with
  considerable rapidity, so that we may regard the transformation which takes place at this stage,
  as in some degree comparable with the great transformation which occurs when the Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  becomes a Petromyzon.</p>

  <p>All the evidence emphasizes the fact that the latter transformation indicates the passage from
  a lower into a higher form of vertebrate, and is to be interpreted phylogenetically as an
  indication of the passage from the Cephalaspidian towards the Dipnoan style of fish. If, then, the
  former transformation is of the same character, it would indicate the passage from the
  Pal√¶ostracan to the Cephalaspid.</p>

  <p>What is the nature of this transformation process as described by Kupffer?</p>

  <p>It is characterized by two most important events. In the first place, up to this time the oral
  chamber has been cut off from the respiratory chamber by a septum&mdash;the velum&mdash;so that no
  food could pass from the mouth to the alimentary canal. At this stage the septum is broken
  through, the oral chamber communicates with the respiratory chamber, and the velar folds of the
  more adult Ammoc&#x0153;tes are left as the remains of the original septum. The other striking
  change is the growth of the upper lip, by which the orifice of the nasal tube is transferred from
  a ventral to a dorsal position. Fig. <a href="#fig100">100</a>, taken from Kupffer's paper,
  represents a sagittal section through an Ammoc&#x0153;tes 4 mm. long; <i>l.l.</i> is the lower
  lip, <i>u.l.</i> the upper lip, and, as is seen, the short oral chamber is closed by the septum,
  <i>vel.</i> Opening ventrally is a tube called the tube of the hypophysis, <i>Hy.</i>, which
  extends close up to the termination of the infundibulum. On the anterior surface of this tube is
  the projection called by Kupffer the olfactory plakode. At this stage the upper lip grows with
  great <span class="pagenum" id="page229">{229}</span>rapidity and thickens considerably, thus
  forcing the opening of the hypophysial tube more and more dorsalwards, until at last, in the
  full-grown Ammoc&#x0153;tes, it becomes the dorsal opening of the nasal tube, as already
  described. Here, then, in the hypophysial tube we have the original position of the olfactory tube
  of the vertebrate ancestor, and it is significant, as showing the importance of this organ, to
  find that such a hypophysial tube is characteristic of the embryological development of every
  vertebrate, whatever may be the ultimate form of the external nasal orifices.</p>

  <p>The single median position of the olfactory organ in the Cyclostomata, in contradistinction to
  its paired character in the rest of the vertebrates, has always been a stumbling-block in the way
  of those who desired to consider the Cyclostomata as degenerated Selachians, for the origin of the
  olfactory protuberance, as a single median plakode, seemed to indicate that the nose arose as a
  single organ and not as a paired organ.</p>

  <p>The comparison of this olfactory organ with the camerostome gives a satisfactory reason for its
  appearance in the lowest vertebrates as an unpaired median organ; equally so, the history of the
  camerostome itself supplies the reason why the olfactory nerves are double, why the organ is in
  reality a paired organ and not a single median one. Thus, in a sense, the grouping of the fishes
  into Monorhin√¶ and Amphirhin√¶ has not much meaning, seeing that the olfactory organ is in all
  cases double.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The evidence of the olfactory organs in the vertebrate not only confirms, in a most
  striking manner, the theory of the origin of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page232">{232}</span>vertebrate from the Pal√¶ostracan, but points indubitably to an origin
  from a scorpion-like rather than a crustacean-like stock. To complete the evidence, it ought to be
  shown that the ancient sea-scorpions did possess an olfactory passage similar to the modern
  land-scorpions. The evidence on this question will come best in the next chapter, where I propose
  to deal with the prosomatic appendages of the Pal√¶ostracan group.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>The vertebrate olfactory apparatus commences as a single median tube which terminates
    dorsally in the lamprey, and is supplied by the two olfactory nerves which arise from the
    supra-infundibular portion of the brain. It is a long, tapering tube which passes ventrally and
    terminates blindly at the infundibulum in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. The dorsal position of the nasal
    opening is not the original one, but is brought about by the growth of the upper lip. The nasal
    tube originally opened ventrally, and was at that period of development known as the tube of the
    hypophysis.</p>
    <p>The evidence of Ammoc&#x0153;tes thus goes to show that the olfactory apparatus started as an
    olfactory tube on the ventral side of the animal, which led directly up to, and probably into,
    the &#x0153;sophagus of the original alimentary canal of the pal√¶ostracan ancestor.</p>
    <p>Strikingly enough, although in the crustaceans the first pair of antenn√¶ form the olfactory
    organs, no such free antenn√¶ are found in the arachnids, but they have amalgamated to form a
    tube or olfactory passage, which leads directly into the mouth and &#x0153;sophagus of the
    animal.</p>
    <p>This olfactory passage is very conspicuous in all members of the scorpion group, and, like
    the olfactory tube of the vertebrate, is innervated by a pair of nerves, which resemble those
    supplying the first pair of antenn√¶ in crustaceans as to their origin from the
    supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia.</p>
    <p>This nasal passage, or tube of the hypophysis, corresponds in structure and in position most
    closely with the olfactory tube of the scorpion group, the only difference being that in the
    latter case it opens directly into the &#x0153;sophagus, while in the former, owing to the
    closure of the old mouth, it cannot open into the infundibulum.</p>
    <p>The evidence of the olfactory apparatus, combined with that of the optic apparatus, is most
    interesting, for, whereas the former points indubitably to an ancestor having scorpion-like
    affinities, the structure of the lateral eyes points distinctly to crustacean, as well as
    arachnid, affinities.</p>
    <p class="sp0">Taking the two together the evidence is extraordinarily strong that the
    vertebrate arose from a member of the pal√¶ostracan group with marked scorpion-like
    affinities.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The derivation of the olfactory organs of the vertebrate from the olfactory antenn√¶ of the
  arthropod in the last chapter is confirmatory proof of the soundness of the proposition put
  forward in Chapter IV., that the segmentation in the cranial region of the vertebrate was derived
  from that of the prosomatic and mesosomatic regions of the pal√¶ostracan ancestor. Such a
  segmentation implies a definite series of body-segments, corresponding to the mesomeric
  segmentation of the vertebrate, and a definite series of appendages corresponding to the
  splanchnic segmentation of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>Of the foremost segments belonging to the supra-&#x0153;sophageal region characterized by the
  presence of the median eyes, of the lateral eyes, and of the olfactory organs, a wonderfully exact
  replica has been shown to exist in the pineal eyes, the lateral eyes, and the olfactory organ of
  the vertebrate, belonging, as they all do, to the supra-infundibular region.</p>

  <p>Of the infra-&#x0153;sophageal segments belonging to the prosoma and mesosoma respectively, the
  correspondence between the mesosomatic segments carrying the branchial appendages and the uterus,
  with those in the vertebrate carrying the branchi√¶ and the thyroid gland respectively, has been
  fully proved in previous chapters.</p>

  <p>There remain, then, only the segments of the prosomatic region to be considered, a region
  which, both in the vertebrate and invertebrate, is never respiratory in function but always
  masticatory, such <span class="pagenum" id="page234">{234}</span>mastication being performed in
  Limulus and its allies by the muscles which move the foot-jaws or gnathites, which are portions of
  the prosomatic appendages specially modified for that purpose, and in the vertebrates by the
  masticatory muscles, which are always innervated by the trigeminal or Vth cranial nerve. This
  comparison implies that the motor part of the trigeminal nerve originally supplied the prosomatic
  appendages.</p>

  <p>The investigations of van Wijhe and of all observers since the publication of his paper prove
  that in this trigeminal region, as in the vagus region, a double segmentation exists, of which the
  ventral or splanchnic segments, corresponding to the appendages in the invertebrate, are supplied
  by the trigeminal nerves, while the dorsal or somatic segments, corresponding to the somatic
  segments in the invertebrate, are supplied by the IIIrd or oculomotor and the IVth or trochlear
  nerves&mdash;nerves which supply muscles moving the lateral eyes.</p>

  <p>In accordance, then, with the evidence afforded by the nerves of the branchial segments, it
  follows that the muscles supplied by the motor part of the trigeminal ought originally to have
  moved the appendages belonging to a series of prosomatic segments. On the other hand, the
  eye-muscles ought to have belonged to the body-part of the prosomatic segments, and must therefore
  have been grouped originally in a segmental series corresponding to the prosomatic appendages.</p>

  <p>The evidence for and against this conclusion will be the subject of consideration in this and
  the succeeding chapters. At the outset it is evident that any such comparison necessitates an
  accurate knowledge of the number of the prosomatic segments in the Gigantostraca and of the nature
  of the corresponding appendages.</p>

  <p>In all this group of animals, the evidence as to the number of segments in either the
  prosomatic or mesosomatic regions is given by&mdash;</p>

  <p>1.  The number of appendages.</p>

  <p>2.  The segmental arrangement of the muscles of the prosoma or mesosoma respectively.</p>

  <p>3.  The segmental arrangement of the c&#x0153;lomic or head-cavities.</p>

  <p>4.  The divisions of the central nervous system, or neuromeres, together with their outgoing
  segmental nerves.</p>

  <p>It follows, therefore, that if from any cause the appendages are not apparent, as is the case
  in many fossil remains, or have dwindled <span class="pagenum" id="page235">{235}</span>away and
  become insignificant, we still have the muscular, c&#x0153;lomic, and nervous arrangements left to
  us as evidence of segmentation in these animals, just as in vertebrates.</p>

  <p>In this prosomatic region, we find in Limulus the same tripartite division of the nerves as in
  the mesosomatic region, so that the nerves to each segment may be classed as (1) appendage-nerve;
  (2) sensory or dorsal somatic nerve, supplying the prosomatic carapace; (3) motor or ventral
  somatic nerve, supplying the muscles of the prosoma, and containing possibly some sensory fibres.
  The main difference between these two regions in Limulus consists in the closer aggregation of the
  prosomatic nerves, corresponding to the concentration of the separate ganglia of origin in the
  prosomatic region of the brain.</p>

  <p>The number of prosomatic segments in Limulus is not evident by examination of the prosomatic
  carapace, so that the most reliable guide to the segmentation of this region is given by the
  appendages, of which one pair corresponds to each prosomatic segment.</p>

  <p>The number of such segments, according to present opinion, is seven, viz.<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(1) The foremost segment, which bears the chelicer√¶.</p>

  <p>(2, 3, 4, 5, 6) The next five segments, which carry the paired locomotor appendages; and</p>

  <p>(7) The last segment, to which belongs a small abortive pair of appendages, known by the name
  of the chilaria, situated between the last pair of locomotor appendages and the operculum or first
  pair of mesosomatic appendages. These appendages are numbered from 1-7 in the accompanying drawing
  (Fig. <a href="#fig103">103</a>).</p>

  <p>Of these seven pairs of appendages, the significance of the first and the last has been matter
  of dispute. With respect to the first pair, or the chelicer√¶, the question has arisen whether
  their nerves belong to the infra-&#x0153;sophageal group, or are in reality
  supra-&#x0153;sophageal.</p>

  <p>It is instructive to observe the nature and the anterior position of this pair of appendages in
  the allied sea-scorpions, especially in Pterygotus, where the only chelate organs are found in
  these long, antenn√¶-like chelicer√¶. In Slimonia and in Stylonurus they are supposed by Woodward to
  be represented by the small non-chelate antenn√¶ seen in Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a>, B and C (p. <a
  href="#page27">27</a>), taken from Woodward. If such is the case, then these figures show that a
  pair of appendages is missing in each <span class="pagenum" id="page236">{236}</span>of these
  forms, for they possess only five free prosomatic appendages instead of six, as in Limulus and in
  Pterygotus. Similarly, Woodward only allowed five appendages for Pterygotus, so that his
  restorations were throughout consistent. Schmidt, in <i>Pterygotus osiliensis</i> has shown that
  the true number was six, not five, as seen in his restoration given in Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a>,
  A (p. <a href="#page27">27</a>).</p>

  <div class="ac w40 fcenter sp2">

      side to show the promesosternite or endostoma (<i>End.</i>).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>With respect to Eurypterus, Schmidt figures an exceedingly minute pair of antenn√¶ between the
  coxal joints of the first pair of appendages, thus making six pairs of appendages. Gerhard Holm,
  however, in his recent beautiful preparations from Schmidt's specimens and others collected at
  Rootzik√ºll, has proved most conclusively that the chelicer√¶ of Eurypterus were of the same kind as
  those of Limulus. I reproduce his figure (Fig. <a href="#fig104">104</a>) showing the small
  chelate chelicer√¶ (1) overhanging the mouth orifice, just as in Limulus or in Scorpio.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page237">{237}</span></div>

  <p>So, also, since Woodward's monograph, Laurie has discovered in <i>Slimonia acuminata</i> a
  small median pair of chelate appendages exactly corresponding to the chelicer√¶ of Limulus, or of
  Eurypterus, or of Scorpio. We may, therefore, take it for granted that such was also the case in
  Stylonurus, and that the foremost pair of prosomatic appendages in all these extinct sea-scorpions
  were in the same position and of the same character as the chelicer√¶ of the scorpions.</p>

  <div class="ac w45 fcenter sp2">

      class="sc">Holm</span>.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the living scorpion and in Limulus the nerves to this pair of appendages undoubtedly arise
  from the foremost prosomatic ganglia, and the reason why they appear to belong to the
  supra-&#x0153;sophageal brain-mass has been made clear by Brauer's investigations on the
  embryology of Scorpio; for he has shown that the cheliceral ganglia shift from the ventral to the
  dorsal side of the &#x0153;sophagus during development, thus becoming
  pseudo-supra-&#x0153;sophageal, though in reality belonging to the infra-&#x0153;sophageal
  ganglia. This cheliceral pair of appendages is, in all probability, homologous with the second
  pair of antenn√¶ in the crustacea.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page238">{238}</span></div>

  <p>I conclude, then, that the chelicer√¶ must truly be included in the prosomatic group, but that
  they stand in a somewhat different category to the rest of the prosomatic appendages, inasmuch as
  they take up a very median anterior and somewhat dorsal position, and their ganglia of origin are
  also exceptional in position.</p>

  <p>Next for consideration come the chilaria (7 in Fig. <a href="#fig103">103</a>), which Lankester
  did not consider to belong to appendages at all, but to be a peculiar pair of sternites. Yet their
  very appearance, with their spinous hairs corresponding to those of the other gnathites and their
  separate nerve-supply, all point distinctly to their being a modified pair of appendages, and,
  indeed, the matter has been placed beyond doubt by the observations of Kishinouye, who has found
  embryologically that they arise in the same way as the rest of the prosomatic appendages, and
  belong to a distinct prosomatic segment, viz. the seventh segment. In accordance with this, Brauer
  has found that in the scorpion there is in the embryo a segment, whose appendages degenerate,
  which is situated between the segment bearing the last pair of thoracic appendages and the genital
  operculum&mdash;a segment, therefore, comparable in position to the chilarial segment of
  Limulus.</p>

  <p>Coming now to the five locomotor appendages, we find that they resemble each other to a
  considerable extent in most cases, with, however, certain striking differences. Thus in Limulus
  they are chelate, with their basal joints formed as gnathites, except in the case of the fifth
  appendage, in which the extremity is modified for the purpose of digging in the sand. In
  Pterygotus, Slimonia, Eurypterus, the first four of these appendages are very similar, and are
  called by Huxley and Woodward endognaths; in all cases they possess a basal part or sterno-coxal
  process, which acts as a gnathite or foot-jaw, and a non-chelate tactile part, which possesses no
  prehensile power, and in most cases could have had no appreciable share in locomotion, called by
  Huxley and Woodward the palpus. These small palps were probably retractile, and capable of being
  withdrawn entirely under the hood. The fifth appendage is usually different, being a large
  swimming organ in Pterygotus, Eurypterus, and Slimonia (Figs. 8 and 104), and is known as the
  ectognath.</p>

  <p>Finally, in <i>Drepanopterus Bembycoides</i>, as stated by Laurie, all five locomotor
  appendages are built up after the same fashion, the last one not being formed as a paddle-shaped
  organ or elongated as <span class="pagenum" id="page239">{239}</span>in Stylonurus, but all five
  possess no special locomotor or prehensile power. According to Laurie this is a specially
  primitive form of the group.</p>

  <p>It is significant to notice from this sketch that with the absence of special prehensile
  terminations such as chel√¶, or the absence of special locomotor functions such as walking or
  swimming, these appendages tend to dwindle and become insignificant, taking up the position of
  mere feelers round the mouth, and at the same time are concentrated and pressed closely together,
  so that their appendage-nerves must also be close together.</p>

  <p>This sketch therefore shows us that&mdash;</p>

  <p>Of the six foremost prosomatic appendages, the chelicer√¶ and the four endognaths were, at the
  time when the vertebrates first appeared, in very many cases dwindling away; the latter especially
  no longer functioned as locomotor appendages, but were becoming more and more mere palps or
  tentacles situated round the mouth, which could by no possibility afford any help to
  locomotion.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the sixth pair of appendages&mdash;the ectognaths&mdash;remained powerful,
  being modified in many cases into large oar-like limbs by which the animal propelled itself
  through the water.</p>

  <p>It is a striking coincidence that those ancient fishes, <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'Ptericthys'.">Pterichthys</span> and Bothriolepis, should have possessed a
  pair of large oar-like appendages.</p>

  <p>At this time, then, in strong contrast to the endognaths, the ectognaths, or sixth pair of
  appendages, remained strong and vigorous. What about the seventh pair, the chilaria of
  Limulus?</p>

  <p>Of all the prosomatic appendages these are the most interesting from the point of view of my
  theory, for whereas in the scorpion of the present day they have dwindled away and left no trace
  except in the embryo, in the sea-scorpions of old, far from dwindling, they had developed and
  become a much more important organ than the chilaria of Limulus.</p>

  <p>In all these animals a peculiarly striking and unique structure is found in this region known
  by the name of the metastoma, or lip-plate (Figs. 8 and 104 (7)); it is universally considered to
  be formed by the fusion of the two chilarial appendages.</p>

  <p>All observers are agreed that this lip-plate was freely movable. Nieskowski considers that the
  movement of the metastoma was entirely in a vertical direction, whereby the cleft which is seen
  <span class="pagenum" id="page240">{240}</span>between the basal joints of all the pairs of
  locomotor appendages could be closed from behind. Woodward says it no doubt represents the labium,
  and served more effectually to enclose the posterior part of the buccal orifice, being found
  exteriorly to the toothed edges of the ectognaths or maxillipedes. Schmidt agrees with Nieskowski,
  and looks on the mestasoma as forming a lower lip within which the bases of the ectognaths
  worked.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Quite recently Gerhard Holm has worked over again the very numerous specimens of <i>Eurypterus
  Fischeri</i>, which are obtainable at Rootzik√ºll, and has thrown new light on the relation of the
  metastoma to the mouth-parts. His preparations show clearly that the true lower lip of Eurypterus
  was not the metastoma, for when the metastoma is removed another plate (<i>End.</i>, Fig. <a
  href="#fig105">105</a>, B) situated <span class="pagenum" id="page241">{241}</span>internally to
  it is disclosed, which, in his view, corresponds to the sternite between the bases of the
  pro-somatic appendages in Limulus, <i>i.e.</i> to the sternite called by Lankester, the
  pro-mesosternite (<i>End.</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig103">103</a>). This inner plate formed with the
  metastoma ((7) Fig. 105) and the ectognaths (6) a chamber closed posteriorly, within which the
  bases of the ectognaths worked. In other words, the removal of the metastoma discloses in
  Eurypterus the true anterior ventral surface of the animal which corresponds to that of Limulus,
  or of the scorpion group, with its pro-mesosternite and laterally attached gnathites or
  sterno-coxal processes. To this inner plate or pro-mesosternite Holm gives the name of
  <i>endostoma</i>.</p>

  <p>To the anterior edge of the endostoma a thinner membrane is attached which passes inwards in
  the direction of the throat, and forms, therefore, the lower lip (<i>Hyp.</i>, Fig. <a
  href="#fig105">105</a>, B) of the passage of the mouth (<i>olf. p.</i>). This membrane bears upon
  its surface a tuft of hairs, which he thought were probably olfactory in function. Consequently,
  in his preliminary communication, he describes this lower lip as forming, in all probability, an
  olfactory organ; in his full communication he repudiates this suggestion, because he thinks it
  unlikely that such an organ would be situated within the mouth. I feel sure that if Holm had
  referred to Croneberg's paper, and seen how the true mouth in all the scorpion group is situated
  at the base of an olfactory passage, he would have recognized that his first suggestion is in
  striking accordance with the nature of the entrance to the mouth in other scorpions.</p>

  <p>That Eurypterus also possessed a camerostome (<i>cam.</i>) seems to follow of necessity from
  its evident affinities both with Limulus and the scorpions. We see, in fact, that the mouth of
  these old sea-scorpions was formed after the fashion of Limulus, surrounded by masticatory organs
  in the shape of foot-jaws, and yet foreshadowed that of the scorpion, so that an ideal sagittal
  section of one of these old pal√¶ostracan forms would be obtained by the combination of actual
  sagittal sections through Limulus and a member of the scorpion group, with, at the same time, a
  due recognition of Holm's researches. Such a section is represented in Fig. <a
  href="#fig105">105</a>, B, in which I have drawn the central nervous system and its nerves, the
  median eyes (<i>C.E.</i>), the olfactory organs (<i>Cam.</i>), the pharynx (<i>Ph.</i>),
  &#x0153;sophagus (<i>&#x0153;s.</i>), and alimentary canal (<i>Al.</i>), but have not tried to
  indicate the lateral eyes. I have represented the prosomatic appendages by numbers (1-7), and
  <span class="pagenum" id="page242">{242}</span>the foremost mesosomatic segments by numbers
  (8-13). I have placed the four endognaths and the nerves going to them close together, and made
  them small, mere tentacles, in recognition of the character of these appendages in Eurypterus, and
  have indicated the position and size of the large ectognath, with its separate nerve, by (6). If
  among the ancient Eurypterus-like forms, which were living at the time when vertebrates first
  appeared, there were some in which the ectognaths also had dwindled to a pair of tentacles, then
  such animals would possess a prosomatic chamber formed by a metastoma or accessory lip, within
  which were situated five pairs of short tactile appendages or tentacles. If the vertebrate were
  derived from such an animal, then the trigeminal nerve, as the representative of these prosomatic
  appendage-nerves, ought to be found to supply the muscles of this accessory lip and of these five
  pairs of tentacles in the lowest vertebrate.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This prosomatic or oral chamber, as it might be called, was limited posteriorly by
  the fused metastoma (7) and operculum (8), so that if in the same imaginary animal one imagines
  that the gill-chambers, instead of being separate, are united to form one large respiratory
  chamber, then, in such an animal, a prosomatic oral chamber, in which the prosomatic appendages
  worked, would be separated from a mesosomatic respiratory chamber by a septum composed of the
  conjoined basal portions of the mesosomatic operculum and the prosomatic metastoma, as indicated
  in the diagram. In this septum the nerves to the last prosomatic appendage (equivalent to the last
  part of the trigeminal in the vertebrate) and to the first mesosomatic (equivalent to the thyroid
  part of the facial) would run, as shown in the figure, close together in the first part of their
  course, and would separate when the ventral surface was reached, to pass headwards and tailwards
  respectively.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Coxal Glands.</span></p>

  <p>One more characteristic of these appendages requires mention, and that is the excretory glands
  situated at the base of the four endognaths known as the coxal glands. These glands are the main
  excretory organs in Limulus and the scorpions, and extend into the basal segments or cox√¶ of the
  four endognaths, not into those of the ectognaths or the chilaria (or metastoma). Hence their
  name, coxal <span class="pagenum" id="page243">{243}</span>glands; and, seeing the importance of
  the excretory function, it is likely enough that they would remain, even when the appendages
  themselves had dwindled away. With the concentration and dwindling of the endognaths these coxal
  glands would also be concentrated, so that in the diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig105">105</a>) they
  would rightly be grouped together in the position indicated (<i>cox. gl.</i>).</p>

  <p class="sp3">Such a diagram indicates the position of all the important organs of the
  head-region except the special organs for taste and hearing. These, for the sake of convenience, I
  propose to take separately, in order at this stage of my argument not to overburden the simplicity
  of the comparison I desire to make with too much unavoidable detail.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Prosomatic Region of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>Let us now compare this diagram with that of the corresponding region in Ammoc&#x0153;tes and
  see whether or no any points of similarity exist.</p>

  <p>With respect to this region, as in so many other instances already mentioned, Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  occupies an almost unique position among vertebrates, for the region supplied by the trigeminal
  nerve&mdash;the prosomatic region&mdash;consists of a large oral chamber which was separated from
  the respiratory chamber in the very young stage by a septum which is subsequently broken through,
  and so the two chambers communicate.</p>

  <p>This chamber is bounded by the lower lip ventrally, the upper lip and trabecular region
  dorsally, and the remains of the septum or velum laterally and posteriorly. It contains a number
  of tentacles arranged in pairs within the chamber so as to form a sieve-like fringe inside the
  circular mouth; of these, the ventral pair are large, fused together, and attached to the lower
  lip.</p>

  <p>All the muscles belonging to this oral chamber are of the visceral type, and are innervated by
  the trigeminal nerve. In accordance with the evidence obtained up to this point this means that
  such an oral chamber was formed by the prosomatic appendages of the invertebrate ancestor,
  similarly to the oral chamber just figured for Eurypterus.</p>

  <p>This chamber in the full-grown Ammoc&#x0153;tes is not only open to the respiratory chamber,
  but is bounded by the large upper lip (<i>U.L.</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, D). On the
  dorsal surface of this region, in front of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page244">{244}</span>pineal eye (<i>C.E.</i>), is the most conspicuous opening of the
  olfactory tube (<i>Na.</i>), which olfactory tube passes from the dorsal region to the ventral
  side to terminate blindly at the very spot where the infundibulum comes to the surface of the
  brain. Here, also, is situated that extraordinary glandular organ known as the pituitary body
  (<i>Pit.</i>). A sagittal section, then, in diagram form, of the position of parts in the
  full-grown Ammoc&#x0153;tes, would be represented as in Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, D.</p>

  <p>But, as argued out in the last chapter, the diagram of the adult Ammoc&#x0153;tes must be
  compared with that of a cephalaspidian fish; the diagram of the pal√¶ostracan must be compared with
  the larval condition of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. In other words, Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, B, must
  be compared with Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, C, which represents a section through the larval
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes as it would appear if it reached the adult condition without any forward growth
  of the upper lip or any breaking through of the septum between the oral and respiratory chambers.
  The striking similarity between this diagram and that of Eurypterus becomes immediately manifest
  even to the smallest details. The only difference between the two, except, of course, the
  notochord, consists in the closure of the mouth opening (<i>o</i>), in Fig. <a
  href="#fig106">106</a>, B, by which the olfactory passage (<i>olf. p.</i>) of the scorpion becomes
  converted into the hypophysial tube (<i>Hy.</i>), Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, C, and later
  into the nasal tube (<i>Na.</i>), Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, D, of the full-grown
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes. That single closure of the old mouth is absolutely all that is required to
  convert the Eurypterus diagram into the Ammoc&#x0153;tes diagram.</p>

  <p>Such a comparison immediately explains in the simplest manner a number of anatomical
  peculiarities which have hitherto been among the great mysteries of the vertebrate organization.
  For not only do the median eyes (<i>C.E.</i>) correspond in position in the two diagrams, and the
  infundibular tube (<i>Inf.</i>) and the ventricles of the brain (<i>C.C.</i>) correspond to the
  &#x0153;sophagus (<i>&#x0153;s.</i>) and the cephalic stomach (<i>Al.</i>), as already fully
  discussed; but even in the very place where the narrow &#x0153;sophagus opened into the wider
  chamber of the pharynx (<i>Ph.</i>), there, in all the lower vertebrates, the narrow infundibular
  tube opens into the wider chamber of the membranous <i>saccus vasculosus</i> (<i>sac. vasc.</i>).
  This is the last portion of the membranous part of the tube of the central nervous system which
  has not received explanation in the previous chapters, and now it is seen how simple its
  explanation is, how natural its presence&mdash;it represents the old pharyngeal chamber of the
  pal√¶ostracan ancestor.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page246">{246}</span></div>

  <p>Next among the mysteries requiring explanation is the pituitary body, that strange glandular
  organ always found so closely attached to the brain in the infundibular region that when it is
  detached in taking out the brain it leaves the infundibular canal patent right into the IIIrd
  ventricle. A comparison of the two diagrams indicates that such a glandular organ (<i>Pit.</i>),
  Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, C, was there because the coxal excretory glands (<i>cox. gl.</i>),
  Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, B, were in a similar position in the pal√¶ostracan
  ancestor&mdash;that, indeed, the pituitary body is the descendant of the coxal glands.</p>

  <p>Finally, the diagrams not only indicate how the mesosomatic appendage-nerves supplying in the
  one case the operculum and the respiratory appendages correspond to the respiratory group of
  nerves, VII., IX., X., supplying in the other case the thyroid, hyoid, and branchial segments, but
  also that a similar correspondence exists between the prosomatic appendage-nerves in the one case
  and the trigeminal nerve in the other; a correspondence which supplies the reason why in the
  vertebrate a septum originally existed between an oral and respiratory chamber.</p>

  <p>Such a comparison, then, leads directly to the suggestion that the trigeminal nerve originally
  supplied the prosomatic appendages, such appendages being: 1. The metastoma, which has become in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes the lower lip supplied by the velar or mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve
  (7); 2. The ectognath, which has become the large median ventral tentacle, called by Rathke the
  tongue, supplied by the tongue nerve (6); 3. The endognaths, which have been reduced to tentacles
  and are supplied by the tentacular branch of the trigeminal nerve (2, 3, 4, 5).</p>

  <p>I have purposely put these two diagrams of the larval Ammoc&#x0153;tes and of Eurypterus before
  the minds of my readers at this early stage of my argument, so as to make what follows more
  understandable. I propose now to consider fully each one of these suggestive comparisons, and to
  see whether or no they are in accordance with the results of modern research.</p>

  <p>In the first instance, the diagrams suggest that the trigeminal nerve originally supplied the
  prosomatic appendages of the pal√¶ostracan ancestor, while the eye-muscle nerves supplied the
  body-muscles of the prosoma.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page247">{247}</span></div>

  <p>As these appendages did not carry any vital organs such as branchi√¶, but were mainly locomotor
  and masticatory in function, it follows that their disappearance as such would be much more
  complete than that of the mesosomatic branchial appendages. Most probably, then, in the higher
  vertebrates no trace of such appendages might be left; consequently the segmentation due to their
  presence would be very obscure, so that in this region the very reverse of what is found in the
  region of the vagus nerve would be the rule. There branchiomeric segmentation is especially
  evident, owing to the persistence of the branchial part of the branchial appendages; here, owing
  to the disappearance of the appendages, the segmentation is no longer branchiomeric, but
  essentially mesomeric in consequence of the persistence of the somatic eye-muscles.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In addition to the evidence of the appendages themselves, the number of prosomatic
  segments is well marked out in all the members of the scorpion group by the divisions of the
  central nervous system into well-defined neuromeres in accordance with the appendages, a
  segmentation the reminiscence of which may still persist after the appendages themselves have
  dwindled or disappeared. In accordance with this possibility we see that one of the most recent
  discoveries in favour of a number of segments in the head-region of the vertebrate is the
  discovery in the early embryo of a number of partial divisions in the brain-mass, forming a system
  of cephalic neuromeres which may well be the rudiments of the well-defined cephalic neuromeres of
  animals such as the scorpion.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Evidence of the Prosomatic Musculature.</span></p>

  <p>Even if the appendages as such become obscure, yet their muscles might remain and show evidence
  of their presence. The most persistent of all the appendage-muscles are the basal muscles which
  pass from coxa to carapace and are known by the name of tergo-coxal muscles. They are large, well
  marked, segmentally arranged muscles, dorso-ventral in direction, and, owing to their connecting
  the limb with the carapace, are likely to be retained even if the appendage dwindles away.</p>

  <p>The muscular system of Limulus and Scorpio has been investigated by Benham and Miss Beck under
  Lankester's direction, and the conclusions to which Lankester comes are these&mdash;</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page248">{248}</span></div>

  <p>The simple musculature of the primitive animal from which both Limulus and the scorpions arose
  consisted of&mdash;</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p>1. A series of paired longitudinal dorsal muscles passing from tergite to tergite of each
    successive segment.</p>
    <p>2. A similar series of paired longitudinal ventral muscles.</p>
    <p>3. A pair of dorso-ventral muscles passing from tergite to sternite in each segment.</p>
    <p>4. A set of dorso-ventral muscles moving the coxa of each limb in its socket.</p>
    <p class="sp0">5. A pair of veno-pericardial muscles in each segment.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Of these groups of muscles, any one of which would indicate the number of segments, Groups 1
  and 2 do not extend into the prosomatic region, and Group 5 extends only as far as the heart
  extends in the case of both Limulus and the Scorpion group; so that we may safely conclude that in
  the Pal√¶ostraca the evidence of somatic segmentation in the prosomatic region would be given, as
  far as the musculature is concerned, by the dorso-ventral somatic muscles (Group 3), and of
  segmentation due to the appendages by the dorso-ventral appendage musculature (Group 4).</p>

  <p>Therefore, if, as the evidence so far indicates, the vertebrate has arisen from a pal√¶ostracan
  stock, we should expect to find that the musculature of the somatic segments in the region of the
  trigeminal nerve did not resemble the segmental muscles of the spinal region, was not, therefore,
  the continuation of the longitudinal musculature of the body, but was dorso-ventral in position,
  and that the musculature of the splanchic segments resembled that of the vagus region, where, as
  pointed out in Chapter IV., the respiratory muscles arose from the dorso-ventral muscles of the
  mesosomatic appendages. This is, of course, exactly what is found for the muscles which move the
  lateral eyes of the vertebrate; these muscles, innervated by the IIIrd, IVth, and VIth nerves,
  afford one of the main evidences of segmentation in this region, are always grouped in line with
  the somatic muscles of spinal segments, and yet cannot be classed as longitudinal muscles. They
  are dorso-ventral in direction, and yet belong to the somatic system; they are exactly what one
  ought to find if they represent Group 3&mdash;the dorso-ventral body-muscles of the prosomatic
  segments of the invertebrate ancestor.</p>

  <p>The interpretation of these muscles will be given immediately; at present I want to pass in
  review all the different kinds of evidence <span class="pagenum" id="page249">{249}</span>of
  segmentation in this region afforded by the examination of the invertebrate, whether living or
  fossil, so as to see what clues are left if the evidence of appendages fails us. I will take in
  the first instance the evidence of segmentation afforded by the presence of the musculature of
  Group 4, even when, as in the case of many fossils, no appendages have yet been found. In such
  animals as Mygale and Phrynus the prosomatic carapace is seen to be marked out into a series of
  elevations and depressions, and upon removing the carapace we see that these elevations correspond
  with and are due to the large tergo-coxal muscles of the appendages; so that if such carapace
  alone were found fossilized we could say with certainty: this animal possessed prosomatic
  appendages the number of which can be guessed with more or less certainty by these indications of
  segments on the carapace.</p>

  <p>In those forms, then, which are only known to us in the fossil condition, in which no
  prosomatic appendages have been found, but which possess, more or less clearly, radial markings on
  the prosomatic carapace resembling those of Phrynus or Mygale, such radial markings may be
  interpreted as due to the presence of prosomatic appendages, which are either entirely concealed
  by the prosomatic carapace or dorsal head-plate, or were of such a nature as not to have been
  capable of fossilization.</p>

  <p>The group of animals in question forms the great group of animals, chiefly extinct, classified
  by H. Woodward under the order of Merostomata. They are divided by him into the sub-order of
  Eurypterid√¶, which includes&mdash;(1) Pterygotus, (2) Slimonia, (3) Stylonurus, (4) Eurypterus,
  (5) Adelophthalmus, (6) Bunodes, (7) Arthropleura, (8) Hemiaspis, (9) Exapinurus, (10)
  Pseudoniscus; and the sub-order Xiphosura, which includes&mdash;(1) Belinurus, (2) Prestwichia,
  (3) Limulus.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page251">{251}</span></div>

  <p>The evidence of the Xiphosura and of the Hemiaspid√¶ conclusively shows, in Woodward's opinion,
  that the Merostomata are closely related to the Trilobita, and the Hemiaspid√¶ especially are
  supposed to be intermediate between the trilobites and the king-crabs. They are characterized, as
  also Belinurus and Prestwichia, by the absence of any prosomatic appendages, so that in these
  cases, as is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig12">12</a> (p. <a href="#page30">30</a>), representing
  <i>Bunodes lunula</i>, found in the Eurypterus layer at Rootzik√ºll, we have an animal somewhat
  resembling Limulus in which the prosomatic appendages have either dwindled away and are completely
  hidden by the prosomatic carapace, or became so soft as not to be preserved in the fossilized
  condition. The appearance of the prosomatic carapace is, to my mind, suggestive of the presence of
  such appendages, for it is marked out radially, as is seen in the figure, in a manner resembling
  somewhat the markings on the prosomatic carapace of Mygale or Phrynus; the latter markings, as
  already mentioned, are due to the aponeuroses between the tergo-coxal muscles of the prosomatic
  appendages which lie underneath and are attached to the carapace.</p>

  <p>A very similar radial marking is shown by Woodward in his picture of <i>Hemiaspis
  limuloides</i>, reproduced in Fig. 109, found in the Lower Ludlow beds at Leintwardine. This
  species has yielded the most perfect specimens of the genus Hemiaspis, which is recognized as
  differing from Bunodes by the possession of a telson.</p>

  <p>It is striking to find that similar indications of segments have been found on the dorsal
  surface of the head-region in many of the most ancient extinct fishes, as will be fully discussed
  later on.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Evidence of C&#x0153;lomic Cavities.</span></p>

  <p>In the head-region of the vertebrate, morphologists depend largely upon the embryonic divisions
  of the mesoderm for the estimation of the number of segments, and, therefore, upon the number of
  c&#x0153;lomic cavities in this region, the walls of which give origin to the striated muscles of
  the head, so that the question of the number of segments depends very largely upon the origin of
  the muscles from the walls of these head-cavities. It is therefore interesting to examine whether
  a similar criterion of segmentation holds good in such a segmented <span class="pagenum"
  id="page252">{252}</span>animal as Limulus, or in the members of the scorpion group, in which the
  number of segments are known definitely by the presence of the appendages. In Limulus we know,
  from the observations of Kishinouye, that a series of c&#x0153;lomic cavities are formed
  embryologically in the various segments of the mesosoma and prosoma, in a manner exceedingly
  similar to their mode of formation in the head-region of the vertebrate, and he has shown that in
  the mesosoma a separate c&#x0153;lomic cavity exists for each segment, so that just as the
  dorso-ventral somatic muscles are regularly segmentally arranged in this region, so are the
  c&#x0153;lomic cavities, and we should be right in our estimation of the number of segments in
  this region by the consideration of the numerical correspondence of these cavities with the
  mesomatic appendages. Similarly, in the vertebrate, we find every reason to believe that a single,
  separate head-cavity corresponds to each of the branchial segments in the opisthotic region, and
  therefore we should estimate rightly the number of segments by the division of the mesoderm in
  this region.</p>

  <p>In the prosomatic region of Limulus, the dorso-ventral muscles are not arranged with such
  absolute segmental regularity as in the mesosomatic region, and Kishinouye's observations show
  that the c&#x0153;lomic cavities in this region do not correspond absolutely with the number of
  prosomatic appendages. His words are<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>A pair of c&#x0153;lomic cavities appears in every segment except the segments of the 2nd, 3rd,
  and 4th appendages, in which c&#x0153;lomic cavities do not appear at all. At least eleven pairs
  of these cavities are produced. The eleventh pair belongs to the seventh abdominal segment.</p>

  <p>The first pair of c&#x0153;lomic cavities is common to the cephalic lobe and the segment of the
  first appendage (<i>i.e.</i> the chelicer√¶).</p>

  <p>The second c&#x0153;lomic cavity belongs to the segment of the fifth appendage. It is well
  developed.</p>

  <p>The ventral portion of the second c&#x0153;lomic cavity remains as the coxal gland.</p>

<hr style="width:6em"/>

  <p>Consequently, if we were to estimate the number of segments in this region by the number of
  c&#x0153;lomic cavities we should not judge rightly, for we should find only four cavities and
  seven appendages, as is seen in the following table<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The second cavity would in reality represent four segments belonging to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th
  locomotor appendages, <i>i.e.</i> the very four segments which in the Eurypterid√¶ are concentrated
  together to form the endognaths, and we should be justified in putting this interpretation on it,
  because, according to Kishinouye, its ventral portion forms the coxal gland, and, according to
  Lankester, the coxal gland sends prolongations into the coxa of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th locomotor
  appendages. Similarly in the vertebrate, we find three head-cavities in the region which
  corresponds, on my theory, to the prosomatic region of Limulus, (1) the anterior cavity discovered
  by Miss Platt, (2) the premandibular cavity, and (3) the mandibular cavity, which, if they
  corresponded with the prosomatic c&#x0153;lomic cavities of Limulus, would represent not three
  segments but seven segments, as follows:&mdash;the anterior cavity would correspond to the first
  c&#x0153;lomic cavity, <i>i.e.</i> the cavity of the cheliceral segments in both Limulus and the
  Eurypterid√¶; the premandibular, to the second c&#x0153;lomic cavity, representing, therefore, the
  2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th prosomatic segments in Limulus and the endognathal segments in the Eurypterid√¶;
  and the mandibular to the 3rd and 4th c&#x0153;lomic cavities, representing the last locomotor and
  chilarial segments in Limulus, <i>i.e.</i> the ectognathal and metastomal segments in the
  Eurypterid√¶.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page254">{254}</span></div>

  <p>It is worthy of note that, in respect to their c&#x0153;lomic cavities, as in the position and
  origin of their nerves in the central nervous system, the first pair of appendages, the chelicer√¶,
  retain a unique position, differing from the rest of the prosomatic appendages.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the table I have shown how the vertebrate c&#x0153;lomic cavities may be
  compared with those of Limulus. The next question to consider is the evidence obtained by
  morphologists and anatomists as to the number of segments supplied by the trigeminal nerve-group;
  this question will be considered in the next chapter.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>In Chapters IV. and V. I have dealt with the opisthotic segments of the vertebrate, including
    therein the segments supplied by the facial nerve, and shown that they correspond to the
    mesosomatic segments of the pal√¶ostracan; consequently the facial (VII.), glossopharyngeal
    (IX.), and vagus (X.) nerves originally supplied the branchial and opercular appendages.</p>
    <p>In this chapter the consideration of the pro-otic segments is commenced, that is, the
    segments supplied by the trigeminal (V.) and the eye-muscle nerves (III., IV., VI.). I have
    considered the VIth nerve with the rest of the eye-muscle nerves for convenience' sake, though
    in reality it belongs to the same segment as the facial. Of these, that part of the trigeminal
    which innervates the muscles of mastication corresponds to the splanchnic segments, while the
    eye-muscle nerves belong to the corresponding somatic segments; but the pro-otic segments of the
    vertebrate ought to correspond to the prosomatic segments of the invertebrate, just as the
    opisthotic correspond to the mesosomatic. Therefore the motor part of the trigeminal ought to
    supply muscles which originally moved the prosomatic appendages, while the eye-muscles ought to
    have belonged to the somatic part of the same segments.</p>
    <p>The first question considered is the number of segments which ought to be found in this
    region. In Limulus, the Eurypterid√¶, and the scorpions there are seven prosomatic segments which
    carry (1) the chelicer√¶, (2, 3, 4, 5) the four first locomotor appendages&mdash;the endognaths,
    (6) the large special appendage&mdash;the ectognath&mdash;and (7) the appendages, which in
    Limulus are known as the chilaria, and are small and insignificant, but in Eurypterus and other
    forms grow forwards, fuse together, and form a single median lip to an accessory oral chamber,
    which lip is known as the metastoma. Of these appendages the chelicer√¶ and endognaths tend to
    dwindle away and become mere tentacles, while the large swimming ectognath and metastoma remain
    strong and vigorous.</p>
    <p>In this, the prosomatic region, the somatic segmentation is not characterized by the presence
    of the longitudinal muscle segments, for they do not extend into this head-region, but only by
    the presence of the segmental somatic <span class="pagenum"
    id="page255">{255}</span>ventro-dorsal muscles. Among the muscles of the appendages the system
    of large tergo-coxal muscles is especially apparent.</p>
    <p>From these considerations it follows that the number of segments in this region in the
    vertebrate ought to be seven; that the musculature supplied by the trigeminal nerve ought to
    represent seven ventral or splanchnic segments, of which only the last two are likely to be
    conspicuous; and that the musculature supplied by the eye-muscle nerves ought to be
    dorso-ventral in direction, which it is, and represent seven dorsal or somatic segments.</p>
    <p>A further peculiarity of this region, both in Limulus and the scorpions, is found in the
    excretory organs which are known by the name of coxal glands, because they extend into the basal
    joint, or coxa, of certain of the prosomatic limbs. The appendages so characterized are always
    the four endognaths, and it follows that if these four endognaths lose their locomotor power,
    become reduced in size, and concentrated together to form mere tentacles, then of necessity the
    coxal glands will be concentrated together, and tend to form a glandular mass in the region of
    the mouth; in fact, take up a position corresponding to that of the pituitary body in
    vertebrates.</p>
    <p>Taking all these facts into consideration, it is possible to construct a drawing of a
    sagittal section through the head-region of Eurypterus, which will represent, with considerable
    probability, the arrangement of parts in that animal. This can be compared with the
    corresponding section through the head of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>
    <p>Now, as pointed out in the last chapter, the early stage of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is remarkably
    different from the more advanced stage; at that time the septum between the oral and respiratory
    chambers has not yet broken through, and the olfactory or nasal tube, known at this stage as the
    tube of the hypophysis, is directed ventrally, not dorsally.</p>
    <p>The comparison of the diagram of Eurypterus with that of the early stage of Ammoc&#x0153;tes
    is remarkably close, and immediately suggests not only that the single nose of the former is
    derived from the corresponding organ in the pal√¶ostracan, but that the pituitary body is derived
    from the concentrated coxal glands, and the lower lip from the metastoma. The further working
    out of these homologies will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>
    <p>In addition to the evidence of segmentation afforded by the appendages, there are in this
    region, in Limulus and the scorpion group, three other criteria of segmentation available to us,
    if from any cause the evidence of appendages fails us. These are&mdash;</p>
    <p>1. The number of neuromeres are marked out in this region of the brain more or less plainly,
    especially in the young animal, just as they are also in the embryo of the vertebrate.</p>
    <p>2. The segmentation is represented here, just as in the mesosomatic region, by two sets of
    muscle-segments; the one <i>somatic</i>, consisting of the segmentally arranged dorso-ventral
    muscles, the continuation of the group already discussed in connection with the mesosomatic
    segmentation, and the other <i>appendicular</i> characterized by the tergo-coxal muscles. These
    latter segmental muscles are especially valuable, for in such forms as Mygale, Phrynus, etc.,
    their presence is indicated externally by markings on the prosomatic carapace, and thus
    corresponding markings found on fossil carapaces or on dorsal head-shields can be <span
    class="pagenum" id="page256">{256}</span>interpreted. These two sets of muscle-segments
    correspond in the vertebrate to the somatic and splanchnic segmentations.</p>
    <p class="sp0">3. In the vertebrate the segmentation in this region is indicated by the
    c&#x0153;lomic or head-cavities, which are cavities formed in the mesoderm of the embryo, the
    walls of which give origin to the striated muscles of the head. In Limulus corresponding
    c&#x0153;lomic cavities are found, which are directly comparable with those found in the
    vertebrate.</p>

  </div>

  <p>From the evidence given in the last chapter, combined with that given in Chapter IV., the
  probability of the theory that the trigeminal group of nerves of the vertebrate have been derived
  from the prosomatic group of nerves of the invertebrate can be put to the test by the answers to
  the following morphological and anatomical questions<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. Do we find in the vertebrate two segmentations in this region corresponding to the two
  segmentations in the branchial region, <i>i.e.</i> a somatic or dorsal series of segments, and a
  splanchnic or ventral series of segments? The latter would not be branchial, but rather of the
  nature of free tactile appendages; so that it is useless to look for or talk about gill-slits,
  although such appendages, being serially homologous with the branchial mesosomatic appendages,
  would readily give rise to the conception of branchial segments.</p>

  <p>2. Is there morphological evidence that the trigeminal nerve is not the nerve belonging to a
  single segment, or even to two segments, but is really a concentration of at least six, probably
  seven, segmental nerves?</p>

  <p>3. Is there morphological evidence that the oculomotor and trochlear nerves, which on all sides
  are regarded as belonging to the trigeminal segments, are not single nerves corresponding each
  <span class="pagenum" id="page258">{258}</span>to a single segment, but are the somatic motor
  roots belonging to the same segments as those to which the trigeminal supplies the splanchnic
  roots?</p>

  <p>4. Do the mesoderm segments, which give origin to the eye-muscles, and therefore do the
  head-cavities of this region, correspond with the trigeminal segments? Considering the
  concentration of parts in this region and the difficulty already presented by the want of
  numerical agreement between the prosomatic appendages and the prosomatic c&#x0153;lomic cavities
  in Limulus, it may very probably be difficult to determine the actual number of the mesoderm
  segments.</p>

  <p>5. Is there anatomical evidence that the ganglion of origin of the motor part of the trigeminal
  nerve is not a single ganglion, but a representative of many, probably seven?</p>

  <p>6. Is there anatomical evidence that the ganglia of origin of the oculomotor and trochlear
  nerves represent many ganglia?</p>

  <p>7. Is there any evidence that the organs originally supplied by the motor part of the
  trigeminal nerve are directly comparable with prosomatic appendages?</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is agreed on all sides that in this region of the head there is distinct
  evidence of double segmentation, the dorsal mesoderm segments giving origin to the eye-muscles,
  and the ventral segments to the musculature innervated by the trigeminal nerve. Originally,
  according to the scheme of van Wijhe, two segments only were recognized, the dorsal parts of which
  were innervated by the IIIrd and IVth nerves respectively. Since his paper, the tendency has been
  to increase the number of segments in this region, as is seen in the following sketch, taken from
  Rabl, of the history of cranial segmentation.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">History of Cranial Segmentation.</span></p>

  <p>The first attempt to deal with this question was made by Goethe and Oken. They considered that
  the cranial skeleton was composed of a series of vertebr√¶, but as early as 1842 Vogt pointed out
  that only the occipital segments could be reduced to vertebr√¶. In 1869, Huxley showed that
  vertebr√¶ were insufficient to explain the cranial segmentation, and that the nerves must be
  specially considered. The olfactory and optic nerves he regarded as parts of the brain, not true
  segmental nerves; the rest of the cranial nerves <span class="pagenum"
  id="page259">{259}</span>were segmental, with special reference to branchial arches and clefts,
  the facial, glossopharyngeal, and separate vagus branches supplying the walls of the various
  branchial pouches. In a similar manner, the supra- and infra-maxillary branches of the trigeminal
  were arranged on each side of the mouth, and the inner and outer twigs of the first (ophthalmic)
  branch of the trigeminal on each side of the orbito-nasal cleft, the trabecular and the
  supra-maxillary arches being those on each side of this cleft. Thus Huxley considered that there
  was evidence of a series of pairs of ventral arches belonging to the skull, viz. the trabecular
  and maxillary in front of the mouth, the mandibular, hyoid, and branchial arches behind, and that
  the Vth, VIIth, IXth, and Xth nerves were segmental in relation to these arches and clefts.
  Gegenbaur, in 1871 and 1872, considered that the branchial arches represented the lower arches of
  cranial vertebr√¶, and therefore corresponded to lower arches in the spinal region, <i>i.e.</i> the
  skull was composed of as many vertebr√¶ as there are branchial arches. These vertebr√¶ were confined
  to the notochordal part of the skull, the prechordal part having arisen secondarily from the
  vertebral part, while the number of vertebr√¶ are at least nine, possibly more. The nerves which
  could be homologized with spinal nerves were, he thought, divisible into two great
  groups&mdash;(1) the trigeminal group, which included the eye-muscle nerves, the facial, and its
  dorsal branch, the auditory; (2) the vagus group, which included the glossopharyngeal and
  vagus.</p>

  <p>Such was the outcome of the purely comparative anatomical work of Huxley and
  Gegenbaur&mdash;work that has profoundly influenced all the views of segmentation up to the
  present day.</p>

  <p>Now came the investigations of the embryologists, of whom I will take, in the first instance,
  Balfour, whose observations on the embryology of the Selachians led him to the conclusion that
  besides the evidence of segmentation to be found in the cranial nerves and in the branchial
  clefts, further evidence was afforded by the existence of head-cavities, the walls of which formed
  muscles just as they do in the spinal region. He came to the conclusion that the first head-cavity
  belonged to one or more pre-oral segments, of which the nerves were the oculomotor, trochlearis,
  and possibly abducens; while there were seven post-oral segments, each with its head-cavity and
  its visceral arch, of which the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and the four parts of the
  vagus were the respective nerves.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page260">{260}</span></div>

  <p>Marshall, in 1882, considered that the cranial segments were all originally respiratory, and
  that all the segmental nerves are arranged uniformly with respect to a series of gill-clefts which
  have become modified anteriorly and have been lost, to a certain extent, posteriorly. He included
  the olfactory nerves among the segmental nerves, and looked upon the olfactory pit, the
  orbito-nasal lacrymal duct, the mouth, and the spiracle as all modified gill-slits, so that he
  reckoned three pre-oral and oral segments belonging to the Ist, IIIrd, IVth, and Vth nerves, and
  eight post-oral segments belonging respectively to the VIIth and VIth nerves, and to the IXth
  nerve, and six segments belonging to the Xth nerve. He pointed out that muscles supplied by the
  oculomotor nerve develop from the outer wall of the first head-cavity; not, however, the
  <i>obliquus superior</i> and <i>rectus externus</i>, the latter originating probably from the
  walls of the third cavity.</p>

  <p>In the same year, 1882, came van Wijhe's well-known paper, in which he showed that the mesoderm
  of the head in the selachian divided into two sets of segments, dorsal and ventral; that the
  dorsal segments were continuous with the body-somites, and that the ventral segments formed the
  lateral plates of mesoblast between each of the visceral and branchial pouches. He concluded that
  the dorsal somites were originally nine in number, that each was supplied with a ventral
  nerve-root, in the same way as the somites in the trunk, and that to each one a visceral pouch
  corresponded, whose walls were supplied by the corresponding dorsal nerve-root; of these nine
  segments, the ventral nerve-roots of the first three segments were respectively the oculomotor,
  trochlearis, and abducens nerves. The next three segments possessed no definable ventral root or
  muscles, and the seventh, eighth, and ninth segments possessed as ventral roots the hypoglossal
  nerve, with its muscular supply. The corresponding dorsal nerve-roots were the trigeminal, facial,
  auditory, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, the difference between cranial and spinal dorsal
  roots being that the former contain motor fibres.</p>

  <p>Ahlborn, in 1884, drew a sharp distinction between the segments of the mesoderm and those of
  the endoderm. The former segmentation he called mesomeric, the latter branchiomeric. He considered
  the two segmentations to be independent, and concluded that the branchiomeric was secondary to the
  mesomeric, and therefore not of <span class="pagenum" id="page261">{261}</span>segmental value. As
  to the segments of the mesoderm in the head, the three hindmost or occipital in Petromyzontid√¶
  remain permanently, and correspond to the three last segments in the selachian head. Of the
  anterior mesoderm segments, he considered that there were originally six, and that there are six
  typical eye-muscles in all Craniota, which have been compressed into three segments, as in
  Selachia.</p>

  <p>Froriep (1885) showed in sheep-embryos and in chicks that the hypoglossal nerve belongs to
  three proto-vertebr√¶ posterior to the vagus region, which were true spinal segments. He therefore
  modified Gegenbaur's conceptions to this extent: that portion of the skull designated by Gegenbaur
  as vertebral must be divided into two parts&mdash;a hind or occipital region, which is clearly
  composed of modified vertebr√¶ and is the region of the hypoglossal nerves, and a front region,
  extending from the oculomotor to the accessorius nerves, which is characterized segmentally by the
  formation of branchial arches, but in which there is no evidence that proto-vertebr√¶ were ever
  formed. He therefore divides the head-skeleton into three parts&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Gegenbaur's evertebral part&mdash;the region of the olfactory and optic nerves&mdash;which
  cannot be referred to any metameric segmentation.</p>

  <p>2. The pseudo-vertebral, pre-spinal, or branchial part, clearly shown to be segmented from the
  consideration of the nerves and branchial arches, but not referable to proto-vertebr√¶&mdash;the
  region of the trigeminal and vagus nerves.</p>

  <p>3. The vertebral spinal part&mdash;the region of the hypoglossal nerves.</p>

  <p>He further showed that the ganglia of the specially branchial nerves, the facial,
  glossopharyngeal, and vagus, are at one stage in connection with the epidermis, so that these
  parts of the epidermis represent sense-organs which do not develop; these organs probably belonged
  to the lateral line system. As the connection takes place at the dorsal edge of the gill-slits,
  they may also be called rudimentary branchial sense-organs.</p>

  <p>Since this paper of Froriep's, it has been generally recognized, and Gegenbaur has accepted
  Froriep's view, that the three hindmost metameres, which distinctly show the characteristics of
  vertebr√¶, belong to the spinal and not to the cranial region, so that the metameric segmentation
  of the cranial region proper has become <span class="pagenum" id="page262">{262}</span>more and
  more associated with the branchial segmentation. Froriep's discovery of the rudimentary branchial
  sense-organs as a factor in the segmentation question has led Beard to the conclusion that the
  olfactory and auditory organs represent in a permanent form two of these rudimentary branchial
  sense-organs. He therefore includes both the olfactory and auditory nerves in his list of cranial
  segmental nerves, and makes eleven cranial branchial segments in front of the spinal segments
  represented by the hypoglossal.</p>

  <p>A still larger number of cranial segments is supposed to exist, according to the researches of
  Dohrn and Killian, in the embryos of <i>Torpedo ocellata</i>. The former, holding to the view that
  vertebrates arose from annelids, considered that the head was formed of a series of metameres, to
  each one of which a mesoderm-segment, a gill-arch, a gill-cleft, a segmental nerve and vessel
  belonged. He found in the front head-region of a Torpedo embryo, corresponding to van Wijhe's
  first four somites, no less than twelve to fifteen mesoderm segments, and concluded, therefore,
  that the eye-muscle nerves, especially the oculomotor, represented many segmental nerves, and were
  not the nerves of single segments; so, also, that the inferior maxillary part of the trigeminal
  and the hyoid nerve of the facial are probably not single nerves, but a fusion of several. Killian
  comes to much the same conclusion as Dohrn, for he finds seventeen to eighteen separate mesoderm
  segments in the head, of which twelve belong to the trigeminal and facial region.</p>

  <p>Since Rabl's paper, a number of papers have appeared, especially from America, dealing with yet
  another criterion of the original segmentation of the head, viz. a series of divisions of the
  central nervous system itself, which are seen at a very early stage of development, and are called
  neuromeres; the divisions in the cranial region being known as encephalomeres, and those of the
  spinal region as myomeres. Locy's paper has especially brought these divisions into prominence as
  a factor in the question of segmentation. They are essentially segments of the epiblast and not of
  the mesoblast; they are conspicuous in very early stages, and appear to be in relation with the
  cranial nerves, according to Locy. He recognizes in <i>Squalus acanthias</i>, in front of the
  spino-occipital region, fourteen pairs of such encephalomeres and a median unsegmented
  termination, which may represent one more pair fused in the middle line, making at least fifteen.
  He distributes these fifteen segments as follows: <span class="pagenum"
  id="page263">{263}</span>fore-brain three and unsegmented termination, mid-brain two, and
  hind-brain nine.</p>

  <p>Again, Kupffer, in his recent papers on the embryology of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, asserts that
  especial information as to the number of primitive segments is afforded by the appearance in the
  early stages of a series of epibranchial ganglia in connection with the cranial nerves, which
  remain permanently in the case of the vagus nerves, but disappear in the case of pro-otic nerves.
  He considers that the evidence points to the number of segments in the mid- and hind-brain region
  as being primitively fifteen, viz. six segments belonging to the trigeminal and abducens group,
  three segments belonging respectively to the facial, auditory, and glossopharyngeal, and six to
  the vagus.</p>

  <p class="sp3">From this sketch we see that the modern tendency is to make six segments at least
  out of the region of the trigeminal nerves rather than two. In this region, as already mentioned,
  the evidence of segmentation is based more clearly on the somatic than on the splanchnic segments.
  We ought, therefore, in the first place, to consider the teaching of the eye-muscles and their
  nerves and the c&#x0153;lomic cavities in connection with them, and see whether the hypothesis
  that such muscles represent the original dorso-ventral somatic muscles of the pal√¶ostracan
  ancestor is in harmony with and explains the facts of modern research.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Eye-Muscles and their Nerves.</span></p>

  <p>The only universally recognized somatic nerves belonging to these segments which exist in the
  adult are the nerves to the eye-muscles, of which, according to van Wijhe, the oculomotor is the
  nerve of the 1st segment, the trochlearis of the 2nd, and the abducens of the 3rd; while the
  nerves and muscles belonging to the 4th and 5th segments, <i>i.e.</i> the 2nd facial and
  glossopharyngeal segments respectively, show only the merest rudiments, and do not exist in the
  adult. One significant fact appears in this statement of van Wijhe, and is accepted by all those
  who follow him, viz. that the oculomotor nerve has equal segmental value with the trochlearis and
  the abducens, although it supplies a number of muscles, each of which, on the face of it, has the
  same anatomical value as the superior oblique or external rectus. Dohrn alone, as far as I know,
  as already pointed out, insists upon the multiple character of the oculomotor nerve.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page264">{264}</span></div>

  <p>As far as the anatomist is concerned, the evidence is becoming clearer and clearer that the
  nucleus of the IIIrd nerve is a composite ganglion composed of a number of nuclei, each similar to
  that of the trochlearis, so that if the trochlearis nucleus is a segmental motor nucleus, then the
  oculomotor nucleus is a combined nucleus belonging to at least four segmental nerves, each of
  which has the same value as that of the trochlearis.</p>

  <p>The investigations of a number of anatomists, among whom may be mentioned Gudden, Obersteiner,
  Edinger, K√∂lliker, Gehuchten, all lead directly to the conclusion that this oculomotor nucleus is
  composed of a number of separate nuclei, of which the most anterior as also the Edinger-Westphal
  nucleus contains small cells, while the others contain large cells. Thus Edinger divides the
  origin of the oculomotor nerve into a small-celled anterior part and a larger posterior part, of
  which the cells are larger and distinctly arranged in three groups&mdash;(1) dorsal, (2) ventral,
  and (3) median. Between the anterior and posterior groups lies the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which
  is small-celled; naturally, the large-celled group is that which gives origin to the motor nerves
  of the eye-muscles, the small-celled being possibly concerned with the motor nerves of the
  pupillary and ciliary muscles. I may mention that K√∂lliker considers that the anterior lateral
  nucleus has nothing to do with the oculomotor nerve, but is a group of cells in which the fibres
  of the posterior longitudinal bundle and of the deep part of the posterior commissure
  terminate.</p>

  <p>These conclusions of Edinger are the outcome of work done in his laboratory by Perlia, who says
  that in new-born animals the nucleus of origin of the oculomotor nerve is made up of a number of
  groups quite distinct from each other, each group being of the same character as that of the
  trochlearis. He finds the same arrangement in various mammals and birds. Further, he finds that
  some of the fibres arise from the nucleus of the opposite side, thus crossing, as in the
  trochlearis; these crossing fibres belong to the most posterior of the dorsal group of nuclei,
  <i>i.e.</i> to the nerve to the inferior oblique muscle.</p>

  <p>The evidence, therefore, points to the conclusion that the oculomotor nucleus is a multiple
  nucleus, each part of which gives origin to one of the nerves of one of the eye-muscles.</p>

  <p>Edinger says that such an array of clinical observations exists, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page265">{265}</span>and of facts derived from post-mortem dissections, that one may venture
  to designate the portion of the nucleus from which the innervation of each individual ocular
  muscle comes. He gives Starr's table, the latest of these numerous attempts, begun by Pick.
  According to Starr, the nuclei of the nerves to the individual muscles are arranged from before
  backward, thus&mdash;</p>

  <p>Further, the evidence of the well-known physiological experiments of Hensen and V√∂lckers that
  the terminal branches of the oculomotor nerve arise from a series of segments of the nucleus,
  arranged more or less one behind the other in a longitudinal row, leads them to the conclusion
  that the nuclei of origin are arranged as follows, proceeding from head to tail<span

  <p>It is instructive to compare this arrangement of Hensen and V√∂lckers with the arrangement of
  the origin of these muscles from the premandibular cavity as given by Miss Platt.</p>

  <p>Thus she states that the most posterior part of the premandibular cavity is cut off so as to
  form a separate cavity, resembling, except in position, the anterior cavity; this separate, most
  posterior part gives origin to the inferior oblique muscle. She then goes on to describe how the
  dorsal wall of the remainder of the premandibular cavity becomes thickened, to form posteriorly
  the rudiment of the inferior rectus and anteriorly the rudiments of the superior and internal
  recti, a slight depression in the wall of the cavity separating these rudiments. The internal
  rectus is the more median of the two anterior muscles. In other words, her evidence points not
  only to a fusion of somites to form the premandibular cavity, but also to the arrangement of these
  somites as follows, from head to tail: (1) internal rectus, (2) superior rectus, (3) inferior
  rectus, (4) inferior <span class="pagenum" id="page266">{266}</span>oblique&mdash;an order
  precisely the same as that of Hensen and V√∂lckers, and of Starr.</p>

  <p>I conclude, from the agreement between the anatomical, physiological, and morphological
  evidence, that the IIIrd and IVth nerves contain the motor somatic nerves belonging to the same
  segments as the motor trigeminal, in other words, to the prosomatic segments, so that the
  eye-muscles, innervated by III. and IV., represent segmental muscles belonging to the prosoma.
  Further, I conclude that originally there were seven prosomatic segments, the first of which is
  represented by the anterior cavity described by Miss Platt, and does not form any permanent
  muscles; that the next four belong to the premandibular cavity, and the muscles formed are the
  superior rectus, internal rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique; and that the last two
  belong to the mandibular cavity, the muscles formed being Miss Platt's mandibular muscle and the
  superior oblique. It is, to say the least of it, a striking coincidence that such an arrangement
  of the c&#x0153;lomic cavities as here given should be so closely mimicked by the arrangement in
  the prosomatic region of Limulus as already mentioned; it suggests inevitably that the
  head-cavities of the vertebrate are nothing more than the prosomatic and mesosomatic segmental
  c&#x0153;lomic cavities, as found in animals such as Limulus. In the table on p. <a
  href="#page253">253</a>, I have inserted the segments in the vertebrate for comparison with those
  of Limulus.</p>

  <p>Before we can come to any conclusion as to the original position of these eye-muscles, it is
  necessary to consider the VIth nerve and the external rectus muscle. This nerve and this muscle
  belong to van Wijhe's 4th segment. The muscle is, therefore, the somatic segmental muscle
  belonging to the same segment as the facial and is, in fact, a segmental muscle belonging not to
  the prosoma, but to the mesosoma. Neal comes to the conclusion that the existing abducens is the
  only root which remains permanent among a whole series of corresponding ventral roots belonging to
  the opisthotic segments, and further points out that the external rectus was originally an
  opisthotic muscle which has taken up a pro-otic position, or, translating this statement into the
  language of Limulus, etc., it is a mesosomatic muscle which has taken up a prosomatic
  position.</p>

  <p>There is, however, another muscle&mdash;the <i>Retractor oculi</i>&mdash;belonging to the same
  group which is innervated by the VIth nerve. Quite recently Edgeworth has shown that in birds and
  reptiles this muscle <span class="pagenum" id="page267">{267}</span>belongs to the hyoid segment;
  so that in this respect also the hyoid segment proclaims its double nature.</p>

  <p>With respect to the external rectus muscle, Miss Platt has shown that the mandibular muscle is
  formed close alongside the external rectus, so that the two are in close relationship as long as
  the former exists.</p>

  <p>Further, as already mentioned, the eye-muscles in Ammoc&#x0153;tes must be considered by
  themselves; they do not belong in structure or position to the longitudinal somatic muscles
  innervated by the spinal nerves; their structure is not the same as that of the tubular
  constrictor or branchial muscles, but resembles that structure somewhat; their position is
  dorso-ventral rather than longitudinal; they may be looked upon as a primitive type of somatic
  muscles segmentally arranged, the direction of which was dorso-ventral.</p>

  <p>Anderson also has shown that the time of medullation of the nerves supplying these muscles is
  much earlier than that of the nerves belonging to the somatic trunk-muscles, their medullation
  taking place at the same time as that of the motor nerves supplying the striated visceral muscles;
  and Sherrington has observed that these muscles do not possess muscle-spindles, while all somatic
  trunk-muscles do. Both these observations are strong confirmation of the view that the eye-muscles
  must be classified in a different category to the ordinary somatic trunk muscle group.</p>

  <p>What, then, is the interpretation of these various embryological and anatomical facts?</p>

  <p>Remembering the tripartite division of each segmental nerve-group in Limulus into (1) dorsal or
  sensory somatic nerve, (2) appendage-nerve, and (3) ventral somatic nerve, I venture to suggest
  that the three nerves&mdash;the <i>oculomotorius</i>, the <i>trochlearis</i>, and the
  <i>abducens</i>&mdash;represent the ventral somatic nerves of the prosoma, and partly also of the
  mesosoma; that they are nerves, therefore, which may have originally contained sensory fibres, and
  which still contain the sensory fibres of the eye-muscles themselves, as stated by Sherrington.
  According to this suggestion, the eye-muscles are the sole survivors of the segmental
  dorso-ventral somatic muscles, so characteristic of the group from which I imagine the vertebrates
  to have sprung. In the mesosomatic region the dorso-ventral muscles which were retained were those
  of the appendages and not of the mesosoma itself, because the presumed ancestor breathed after the
  fashion of the water-breathing Limulus, by means of the dorso-ventral muscles of its <span
  class="pagenum" id="page268">{268}</span>branchial appendages, and not after the fashion of the
  air-breathing scorpion, by means of the dorso-ventral muscles of the mesosoma. The only
  mesosomatic dorso-ventral muscles which were retained were those of the foremost mesosomatic
  segments, <i>i.e.</i> those supplied by the VIth nerve, which were preserved owing to their having
  taken on a prosomatic position and become utilized to assist in the movements of the lateral
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Let us turn now to the consideration of the corresponding musculature in Limulus and in the
  scorpion group. These muscles constitute the markedly segmental muscles to which I have given the
  name 'dorso-ventral somatic muscles.' They are most markedly segmental in the mesosomatic region,
  both in Limulus and in Scorpio, each mesosomatic segment possessing a single pair of these
  vertical mesosomatic muscles, as Benham calls them (<i>cf.</i> Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>
  (<i>Dv.</i>)). In the prosomatic region the corresponding muscles are not so clearly defined in
  Limulus; they are apparently attached to the plastron forming the group of plastro-tergal muscles.
  From Benham's description it is sufficiently evident that they formed originally a single pair to
  each prosomatic segment.</p>

  <p>In Scorpio, according to Miss Beck, the dorso-ventral prosomatic muscles are situated near the
  middle line on each side and form the following well-marked series of pairs of muscles, shown in
  Fig. <a href="#fig110">110</a>, A, taken from her paper, and thus described by her<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. The dorso-cheliceral-sternal muscle (61) is the most anterior of the dorso-ventral muscles.
  It is very small, and is attached to the carapace near the median line anteriorly to the central
  eyes.</p>

  <p>2. The median dorso-preoral-entosclerite muscle (62) is a large muscle, between which and its
  fellow of the opposite side the eyes are situated. It is attached dorsally to the carapace and
  ventrally to the pre-oral entosclerite.</p>

  <p>3. The anterior dorso-plastron muscle (63) is attached dorsally to the carapace in the middle
  line, being joined to its fellow of the opposite side. They separate, and are attached ventrally
  to the plastron. Through the arch thus formed the alimentary canal and the dorsal vessel pass.</p>

  <p>4. The median dorso-plastron muscle (64) is attached dorsally to the posterior part of the
  carapace. It runs forward on the anterior surface of the posterior flap of the plastron to the
  body of the plastron, to which it is attached.</p>

  <p>To these may be added, owing to its attachment to the plastron,</p>

  <p>5. The posterior dorso-plastron muscle (65). This is the first of the dorso-ventral muscles
  attached to the mesosomatic tergites, being attached to the tergite of the first segment of the
  mesosoma.</p>

  <p>This muscle is of interest, in connection with the prosomatic dorso-ventral muscles, because it
  is attached to the plastron, and runs a course in close contact with the muscle (64), the two
  muscles being attached dorsally close together, on each side of the middle line, the one at the
  very posterior edge of the prosomatic carapace, and the other at the very anterior edge of the
  mesosomatic carapace.</p>

  <p>Taking these muscles separately into consideration, it may be remarked with respect to (61)
  that the cheliceral segment in its paired dorso-ventral muscles, as in its tergo-coxal muscles,
  takes up a separate position isolated from the rest of the prosomatic segments.</p>

  <p>Next comes (62) the median dorso-preoral-entosclerite muscle, which is strikingly different
  from all the other dorso-ventral muscles in its large size and the extent of its attachment to the
  dorsal carapace, according to Miss Beck's figures. The reason of its large size is clearly seen
  upon dissection of the muscles in <i>Buthus</i>, for I find that, strictly speaking, it is not a
  single muscle, but is composed of a series of muscle-bundles, separated from each other by
  connective tissue. There are certainly three separate muscles included in this large muscle, which
  are attached in a distinct series along the pre-oral entosclerite, and present the appearance
  given in Fig. <a href="#fig110">110</a>, A, at their attachment to the prosomatic carapace. Of
  this muscle-group the most anterior and the most posterior bundle are distinctly separate muscles;
  I am not, however, clear whether the middle bundle represents one or two muscles.</p>

  <p>This division of Miss Beck's muscle (62) into three or four muscles brings the prosomatic
  region of the scorpion into line with the mesosomatic, and enables us to feel sure that a single
  pair of dorso-ventral somatic muscles belongs to each prosomatic segment just as to each
  mesosomatic, and, conversely, that each such single pair of muscles possesses segmental value in
  this region as much as in the mesosomatic.</p>

  <p>It is very striking to see how in all the Scorpionid√¶, in which the two median eyes are the
  principal eyes, this muscle group (62) on the two sides closely surrounds these two eyes, so that
  with a fixed <span class="pagenum" id="page271">{271}</span>pre-oral entosclerite, a slight
  movement of the eyes, laterally or anteriorly, owing to the flexibility of the carapace, might
  result as the consequence of their contraction. But this cannot be the main object of these
  muscles. The pre-oral entosclerite is firmly fixed to the camerostome, as is seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig94">94</a>, <i>pr. ent.</i>, so that the main object of these muscles is, as Huxley has
  pointed out, the movement of this organ.</p>

  <p>In order to avoid repetition of the long name given to this muscle group (62) by Miss Beck,
  because of their position, and for other reasons which will appear in the sequel, I will call this
  group of muscles the group of recti muscles. These recti muscles belong clearly to the segments
  posterior to the first prosomatic or cheliceral segment, and represent certainly three, probably
  four, of these segments, <i>i.e.</i> belong to the segments corresponding to the second, third,
  fourth, and fifth prosomatic locomotor appendages&mdash;the endognaths of the old Eurypterids.</p>

  <p>The next pair of muscles is the pair of anterior dorso-plastron muscles (63). This muscle-pair
  evidently belongs to a segment posterior to the segments represented by the group already
  discussed, and belongs, therefore, in all probability to the same segment as the sixth pair of
  prosomatic appendages&mdash;the ectognaths of the old Eurypterids. This can be settled by
  considering either the nerve-supply or the embryological development. In the Eurypterid√¶ it seems
  most highly probable that the dorso-ventral muscles of each half of the segments belonging to the
  endognaths should be compressed together and separate from the dorso-ventral muscle belonging to
  the ectognathal segment, on account of the evident concentration and small size of the endognathal
  segments in contradistinction to the separateness and large size of the ectognathal segment.</p>

  <p>The striking peculiarity of this muscle-pair, which distinguishes it from all other muscles in
  the scorpion, is the common attachment of the muscles of the two sides in the mid-dorsal line, so
  that the pair of muscles forms an arch through which the alimentary canal and dorsal blood-vessel
  pass.</p>

  <p>The same dorso-ventral muscles are present in <i>Phrynus</i>, and in this animal the fibres of
  this pair of muscles (63) actually interlace before the attachment to the prosomatic carapace, so
  that the attachment of the muscle on each side overpasses the mid-dorsal line, and a true crossing
  occurs. In Fig. <a href="#fig108">108</a> the position of this pair of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page272">{272}</span>muscles is shown just posteriorly to the brain-mass. This muscle I will
  call the oblique muscle.</p>

  <p>Finally we come to the muscles (64) and (65), the median and posterior dorso-plastron muscles,
  which run close together. Both muscles are attached to the plastron, and, therefore, to that
  extent belong to the prosomatic region; they are attached dorsally close to the junction of the
  prosoma and mesosoma. This position of the first mesosomatic dorso-ventral muscle belonging to the
  opercular segment may be compared with the position of the first mesosomatic dorso-ventral muscle
  in Limulus which has become attached to the prosomatic carapace; in both cases we see an
  indication that the foremost pair of mesosomatic dorso-ventral somatic muscles tend to take up a
  prosomatic position.</p>

  <p>As to the pair of small muscles (64), I believe that they represent the dorso-ventral muscles
  of the seventh prosomatic segment (if the pair of muscles (63) belongs to the segment of the sixth
  locomotor prosomatic appendages), <i>i.e.</i> they belong to the chilarial segment or
  metastoma.</p>

  <p>I desire to draw especial attention to the fact that the dorso-ventral muscle (64), which
  represents the seventh segment, always runs close alongside the dorso-ventral muscle (65), which
  represents the first mesosomatic or opercular segment.</p>

  <p>The comparison, then, of these two sets of facts leads to the following conclusions<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The foremost prosomatic or trigeminal segment stood separate and apart, being situated most
  anteriorly; the musculature of this segment does not develop, so that the only evidence of its
  presence is given by the anterior c&#x0153;lomic cavity. This corresponds, according to my scheme,
  with the first or anterior c&#x0153;lomic cavity of Limulus, and therefore represents, as far as
  the prosomatic appendages are concerned, the first prosomatic appendage-pair, or the chelicer√¶;
  the appendage-muscles being the muscles of the chelicer√¶, and the dorso-ventral somatic muscles
  the pair of dorso-cheliceral sternal muscles (61) in the scorpion. Both these sets of muscles,
  therefore, dwindle and disappear in the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>Then came four segments fused together to form the premandibular segment, the characteristic of
  which is the apparent non-formation of any permanent musculature from the ventral
  mesoderm-segments, and the formation of the eye-muscles innervated by the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page273">{273}</span>oculomotor nerve from the dorsal mesoderm segments. These four segments
  have been so fused together that van Wijhe looked upon them as a single segment, and the
  premandibular cavity as the cavity of a single segment. They represent, according to my scheme,
  the segments belonging to the endognaths, <i>i.e.</i> the second, third, fourth, fifth pairs of
  prosomatic appendages; the premandibular cavity, therefore, represents the second c&#x0153;lomic
  cavity in Limulus, which, according to Kishinouye, is the sole representative of the
  c&#x0153;lomic cavities of the second, third, fourth, fifth prosomatic segments. The muscles
  derived from the ventral mesoderm-segments represent the muscles of these appendages, which
  therefore dwindle and disappear in the vertebrate, with the possible exception of the muscles
  innervated by the descending root of the trigeminal. The muscles derived from the dorsal
  mesoderm-segments, <i>i.e.</i> the eye-muscles supplied by the oculomotor nerve, represent the
  dorso-ventral somatic muscles of these four segments, muscles which are represented in the
  scorpion by the recti group of muscles, <i>i.e.</i> the median dorso-preoral-entosclerite muscles
  (62).</p>

  <p>Then came two segments, the mandibular, in which muscles are formed both from the ventral and
  from the dorsal mesoderm-segments. From the former arose the main mass of muscles innervated by
  the motor root of the trigeminal, from the latter the superior oblique muscle and the mandibular
  muscle of Miss Platt, of which the former alone survives in the adult condition. These two
  segments are looked upon as a single segment by van Wijhe, of which the mandibular cavity is the
  c&#x0153;lomic cavity. They represent, according to my scheme, the segments belonging to the sixth
  pair of prosomatic appendages or ectognaths, and the seventh pair, <i>i.e.</i> the chilaria or
  metastoma.</p>

  <p>The first part, then, of the mandibular cavity represents the third c&#x0153;lomic cavity in
  Limulus and the muscles derived from the ventral mesoderm, in all probability the muscles of the
  tongue in the lamprey (<i>cf.</i> Chap. IX.), which represents the ectognaths or sixth pair of
  prosomatic appendages, while the muscles derived from the dorsal mesoderm, <i>i.e.</i> the
  superior oblique muscles, represent the dorso-ventral somatic muscles of this segment, muscles
  which are represented in the scorpion group by the pair of anterior dorso-plastron or oblique
  muscles (63).</p>

  <p>The second part of the mandibular cavity represents the 4th <span class="pagenum"
  id="page274">{274}</span>c&#x0153;lomic cavity in Limulus and the muscles derived from the ventral
  mesoderm, in all probability the muscles of the lower lip in the lamprey (<i>cf.</i> Chap. IX.),
  which represents the metastoma; while the muscles derived from the dorsal mesoderm, <i>i.e.</i>
  Miss Platt's pair of mandibular muscles, represent the dorso-ventral somatic muscles of this
  segment, muscles which are represented in the scorpion group by the pair of median dorso-plastron
  muscles (64).</p>

  <p>In connection with this last pair of muscles we find that the external rectus in the vertebrate
  represents the first dorso-ventral mesosomatic muscle in the scorpion, <i>i.e.</i> the posterior
  dorso-plastron muscle (65), and, as already mentioned (p. <a href="#page267">267</a>), that it
  always lies closely alongside the mandibular muscle, just as in the scorpion group muscle (65)
  always lies alongside muscle (64).</p>

  <p>In the invertebrate as well as in the vertebrate this muscle is a mesosomatic muscle which has
  taken up a prosomatic position.</p>

  <p>The question naturally arises, what explanation can be given of the fact that these
  dorso-ventral muscles attached on each side of the mid-dorsal line to the prosomatic carapace
  became converted into the muscles moving the eyeballs of the two lateral eyes? An explanation
  which must take into account not only the isolated position of the abducens nerve, but also the
  extraordinary course of the trochlearis. The natural and straightforward answer to this question
  appears to me quite satisfactory, and I therefore venture to commend it to my readers.</p>

  <p>I have argued the case out to myself as follows: The lateral eyes must have been originally
  situated externally to the group of muscles innervated by the oculomotor nerve, for a sheet of
  muscle representing the superior <i>internal</i> and inferior rectus muscles could only wrap round
  the internal surface of each lateral eye; <i>i.e.</i> the arrangement of the muscle-sheet, as in
  the scorpion, about two median eyes, is in the wrong position, for if those two eyes, which are
  the main eyes in the scorpion, were to move outwards to become two lateral eyes, then such a
  muscle-group would form a superior <i>external</i> and inferior rectus group. The evidence,
  however, of Eurypterus and similar forms is to the effect that the lateral eyes became big and the
  median eyes insignificant and degenerate. If, then, with the degeneration of the one and the
  increasing importance of the other, these lateral eyes came near the middle line, then the
  muscular group (62), which I have called the recti group, would naturally be pressed into their
  <span class="pagenum" id="page275">{275}</span>service, and would form an internal and not an
  external group of eye-muscles.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig110">110</a>, A, taken from Miss Beck's paper, I have shown the relative
  position of the eyes and the segmental dorso-ventral prosomatic muscles on the carapace of the
  scorpion. In Fig. <a href="#fig110">110</a>, B, I have drawn the prosomatic carapace of
  <i>Eurypterus Scouleri</i>, taken from Woodward's paper, with the eyes as represented there; in
  this I have inserted the segmental dorso-ventral muscles as met with in the scorpion, thereby
  demonstrating how, with the degeneration of the median eyes and the large size of the lateral
  eyes, the recti muscles of the scorpion would approach the position of an internal recti group to
  the lateral eyes, and so give origin to the group of muscles innervated by the oculomotor nerve.
  In the Eurypterus these large eyes are large single eyes, not separate ocelli, as in the
  scorpion.</p>

  <p>All, then, that is required is that in the first formed fishes, which still possessed the
  dorso-ventral muscles of their Eurypterid ancestors, the lateral eyes should be the important
  organs of sight, large and near the mid-dorsal line. Such, indeed, is found to be the case. In
  amongst the masses of Eurypterids found in the upper Silurian deposits at Oesel, as described by
  Rohon, numbers of the most ancient forms of fish are found belonging to the genera Thyestes and
  Tremataspis. The nature of the dorsal head-shields of these fishes is shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig14">14</a>, which represents the dorsal head-shield of <i>Thyestes verrucosus</i>, and
  Fig. <a href="#fig111">111</a> that of <i>Tremataspis Mickwitzi</i>. They show how the two lateral
  eyes were situated close on each side of the mid-dorsal line in these Eurypterus-like fishes, in
  the very position where they must have been if the eye-muscles were derived from the dorso-ventral
  somatic muscles of a Eurypterid ancestor.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In Lankester's words, one of the characteristics of the Osteostraci (Cephalaspis, Auchenaspis,
  etc.), as distinguished from the Heterostraci (Pteraspis), are the large orbits placed near the
  centre of the shield. The apparent exception of Thyestes mentioned by him is no <span
  class="pagenum" id="page276">{276}</span>exception, for orbits of the same character have since
  been discovered, as is seen in Rohon's figure (Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>). In Fig. <a
  href="#fig110">110</a>, C, I give an outline of the frontal part of the head-shield of a
  Cephalaspid, in which I have drawn the eye-muscles as in the other two figures.</p>

  <p>Although all the members of the Osteostraci possess large lateral eyes towards the centre of
  the head-shield, the other group of ancient fishes, the Heterostraci, are characterized by the
  presence of lateral eyes far apart, situated on the margin of the head-shield on each side
  (<i>cf.</i> Fig. 142, <i>o</i>, p. <a href="#page350">350</a>).</p>

  <p>So, also, on the invertebrate side, the lateral eyes of Pterygotus and Slimonia are situated on
  the margin of the prosomatic carapace, while those of Eurypterus and Stylonurus are situated much
  nearer the middle line of the prosomatic carapace.</p>

  <p>Next comes the question of the superior oblique muscle and the trochlearis nerve. Why does this
  nerve (<i>n.IV.</i> in Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, C and D) alone of all the nerves in the
  body take the peculiar position it always does take? The only suggestion that I know of which
  sounds reasonable and worth consideration is that put forward by F√ºrbringer, which is an
  elaboration of the original suggestion of Hoffmann. Hoffmann suggested in 1889 that the
  trochlearis nerve represented originally a nerve for a protecting organ of the pineal eye, which
  became secondarily a motor nerve for the lateral eye as the pineal eye degenerated. F√ºrbringer
  differs from Hoffmann in that he considers that the nerve was originally a motor nerve, and was
  not transformed from sensory to motor, yet thinks Hoffmann's suggestion is in the right
  direction.</p>

  <p>He points out that the crossing of the trochlearis is not a crossing of fibres between two
  centres in the central nervous system, but may be explained by the shifting of the peripheral
  organ, <i>i.e.</i> the muscle, from one side to the other, and the nerve following this shift.
  Consequently, says F√ºrbringer, the course of the nerve indicates the original position of the
  muscle, and therefore he imagines that the ancestor of the superior oblique muscle was a muscle
  the fibres of which were attached in the mid-dorsal line, and interlaced with those of the other
  side, the two muscles thus forming an arch through which the nervous system with its central canal
  passed. Then, for the sake of getting a more efficient pull, the crossing muscle-fibres became
  more definitely attached to the opposite side of the middle line, and finally obtained a new
  attachment on the opposite side, with the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page277">{277}</span>obliteration of the muscular arch; the nerve on each side, following the
  shifts of the muscle, naturally took up the position of the original muscular arch, and so formed
  the trochlear nerve, with its dorsal crossing. This explanation of F√ºrbringer's was associated by
  him with movements of the median pineal eyes, the length of their nerve, according to him, even
  yet indicating their previous mobility. This assumption is not, it seems to me, necessary. The
  length of the nerve is certainly no indication of mobility, for in Limulus and the scorpion group
  the nerve to each median eye is remarkably long, yet these eyes are immovably fixed in the
  carapace. All that is required is a pair of dorso-ventral muscles belonging to the segment
  immediately following the group of segments represented by the oculomotor nerves, the fibres of
  which should cross the mid-dorsal line at their attachment; for, seeing that the lateral eyes were
  originally so near this position, it follows that such muscles might form part of the muscular
  group belonging to the lateral eye without having previously moved the pineal eyes. In fact,
  F√ºrbringer's explanation requires as starting-point that the pair of muscles which ultimately
  become the superior oblique should have the exact position of the pair of dorso-ventral muscles in
  the scorpion, called by Miss Beck the anterior dorso-plastron muscles (63), which I have named the
  oblique muscles. Here, and here only, do we find an interlacement, across the mid-dorsal line, of
  the fibres of attachment of the muscles on the two sides, in consequence of which this pair of
  muscles is described by her as forming an arch encircling the alimentary canal and dorsal vessel.
  If, then, as I have previously argued, the primitive plastron formed a pair of trabecul√¶, and the
  nervous system grew round the alimentary canal, such an arch would encircle the tubular central
  nervous system of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>Still more striking is this pair of muscles (63) in Phrynus (Fig. 108), where we see how the
  arch formed by them almost touches the posterior extremity of the supra-&#x0153;sophageal
  brain-mass, crossing, therefore, over the beginning of the stomach region of the animal. The angle
  formed by the arch is much more obtuse than that formed in Scorpio, so that an actual crossing of
  the muscle-fibres has taken place at the point of attachment to the carapace. Also, only the part
  nearest the carapace is muscular, the rest forming a long tendinous prolongation of the plastron
  wall (the primordial cranium), as seen in the figure.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page278">{278}</span></div>

  <p>This muscle-pair is, as it should be, the pair of dorso-ventral muscles belonging to the
  segment immediately following on the group of segments represented by the recti muscles,
  <i>i.e.</i> according to previous argument, the segment belonging to the sixth pair of locomotor
  appendages or ectognaths; a muscle, therefore, which would arise in the vertebrate from the
  mandibular, and not from the premandibular cavity. A similar muscle probably existed in Eurypterus
  (<i>M.obl.</i> in Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, B), and, as in the case of the formation of the
  oculomotor group, derived from the recti group of the scorpion, would form the commencement of the
  superior oblique muscle in Thyestes and Tremataspis.</p>

  <div class="ac w45 fcenter sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is instructive to notice that the original position of attachment of this muscle is
  naturally posterior to that of the oculomotor group of muscles, and that F√ºrbringer, in his
  description of the eye-muscles of Petromyzon, asserts that this muscle in this primitive
  vertebrate <span class="pagenum" id="page279">{279}</span>form is not attached as in other
  vertebrates, but is posterior to the other muscles, so that he calls it the posterior rather than
  the superior oblique. The nature of the change by which the muscle known in the scorpion as the
  anterior dorso-plastron muscle (63) was probably converted into the superior oblique muscle of the
  vertebrate, is represented in the drawings Fig. <a href="#fig112">112</a>, in which also are
  indicated the dwindling of the median eyes, and the progressive superiority of the lateral eyes,
  as well as the transformation of the recti muscle-group of the scorpion into the muscles supplied
  by the oculomotor nerve of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>With respect to the external rectus muscle, it follows naturally that if the muscles (64) and
  (65) are to follow suit with the rest of the group and become attached to the lateral eyes, they
  must take up an external position. These two muscles, which always run together, as seen in Fig.
  <a href="#fig110">110</a>, A, the one belonging to the prosoma and the other to the mesosoma, are
  represented by the mandibular muscle of Miss Platt and the external rectus, the former derived
  from the walls of the last pro-otic head-cavity, the latter from the foremost of the opisthotic
  head-cavities.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Such, then, is the simple explanation of the origin of the eye-muscles which
  follows from my theory, and we see that the successive alterations of the position of the orbit,
  and, therefore, of the globe of the eye with its muscles, as we pass from Thyestes to man, is the
  natural consequence of the growth of the frontal bone, <i>i.e.</i> of the brain.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Trigeminal Nerves and the Muscles supplied by them.</span></p>

  <p>Turning now to the evidence as to the number of ventral segments, <i>i.e.</i> the motor and
  sensory supply to the prosomatic appendages afforded by the trigeminal nerve, we must, I think,
  come to the same conclusion as Dohrn, viz. that if there were originally seven dorsal or somatic
  segments in this region represented by: 1, Anterior cavity, muscle lost; 2, 3, 4, 5, muscles of
  the premandibular cavity, <i>sup. rectus</i>, <i>inf. rectus</i>, <i>int. rectus</i>, <i>inf.
  oblique</i>, supplied by IIIrd nerve; 6, 7, muscles of the mandibular cavity, <i>sup. oblique</i>,
  supplied by IVth nerve and muscle lost, there must have been also seven corresponding ventral or
  splanchnic segments supplied by the trigeminal. At present the evidence for such segments is
  nothing like so strong as for the corresponding somatic ones; there are, however, certain
  suggestive <span class="pagenum" id="page280">{280}</span>facts which point distinctly in this
  direction in connection with both the motor and sensory parts of the trigeminal. The origin of the
  trigeminal motor fibres in the central nervous system is most striking. We may take it for granted
  that a nucleus of cells giving origin to one or more segmental motor nerves will possess a greater
  or less longitudinal extension in the central nervous system, according to the number of fused
  separate segmental centres it represents. Thus a nucleus such as that of the IVth nerve or of the
  facial is small and compact in comparison to the extensive conjoint nucleus of the vagus and
  cranial accessory.</p>

  <p>Upon examination of the motor nucleus of the trigeminal, we find a compact or well-defined
  nucleus, the <i>nucl. masticatorius</i>, the nerves of which supply the masseter, temporal, and
  other muscles, so that the anatomical evidence at first sight appears to bear out van Wijhe's
  conclusion that the motor trigeminal supplies at most two segments. Further examination, however,
  shows that this is not all, for the extraordinary so-called descending root of the Vth must be
  taken into consideration in any question of the origin of the motor elements, just as the equally
  striking ascending root enters into the consideration of the meaning of the sensory elements of
  the Vth.</p>

  <p>It is not necessary here to discuss the controversy as to whether this descending root is motor
  or sensory. It is universally considered at present to be motor, and is believed to supply, as
  K√∂lliker suggested, among other muscles, the <i>m. tensor tympani</i> and the <i>m. tensor veli
  palati</i>. It is thus described by Obersteiner&mdash;</p>

  <p>"From the region of the mid-brain the motor root receives an important addition of thick
  fibres, which form the cerebral or descending root. The large, round vesicular cells from which
  the fibres of the descending root arise form no single compact group, but are partly single,
  partly arranged like little bunches of grapes, as far as the region of the anterior corpora
  quadrigemina. The further we go brainwards, the smaller is the number of fibres. In the region of
  the anterior corpora quadrigemina, the few cells of origin are found more and more median; so that
  the uppermost trigeminal fibres descend in curves almost from the mid-line, as is shown by the
  exceptional occurrence of one or more of the characteristic cells above the aqueduct. At the
  height of the posterior commissure one finds the last of these trigeminal cells."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page281">{281}</span></div>

  <p>The anatomy of the Vth nerve reveals, then, three most striking facts<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. The motor nucleus of the Vth extends from the very commencement of the infra-infundibular
  region to nearly the commencement of the nucleus of the VIIth; in other words, the motor nucleus
  of the Vth extends through the whole prosomatic region, just as it must have done originally if
  its motor nerves supplied the muscles of the prosomatic appendages. Such an extended range of
  origin is indicative of the remains of an equally extended series of segmental centres or
  ganglia.</p>

  <p>2. Of these centres the caudalmost have alone remained large and vigorous, constituting the
  <i>nucleus masticatorius</i>, which in the fish is divided into an anterior and posterior group,
  thus indicating a double rather than a single nucleus; while the foremost ones have dwindled away
  until they are represented only by the cells of the descending root, the muscles of these segments
  being still represented by possibly the <i>tensor veli palati</i> and the other muscles innervated
  from these cells.</p>

  <p>3. The headmost of these cells takes up actually a position dorso-lateral to the central canal,
  so that the groups on each side nearly come together in the mid-dorsal line; a very unique and
  extraordinary position for a motor cell-group, but not improbable when we recall to mind Brauer's
  assertion as to the shifting of the foremost prosomatic ganglion-cells of the scorpion from the
  ventral to the dorsal side of the alimentary canal.</p>

  <p>On the sensory side the evidence is also suggestive, the question here being not so much the
  distribution of the sensory nerves as the number of ganglia belonging to each of the cranial
  nerves.</p>

  <p>With respect to this question, morphologists have come to the conclusion that there is a marked
  difference between spinal and cranial nerves, in that whereas the posterior root-ganglia of the
  spinal nerves arise from the central nervous system itself, <i>i.e.</i> from the neural crest, the
  ganglia of the cranial nerves arise partly from the neural crest, partly from the proliferation of
  cells on the surface of the animal; and because of the situation of these proliferating epidermal
  patches over the gill-clefts in the case of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, they have been
  called by Froriep and Beard branchial sense-organs. Beard divides the cranial ganglia into two
  sets, one connected with the neural ridges, called the neural ganglia, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page282">{282}</span>and the other connected with the surface-cells, which he calls the
  lateral ganglia. This second set corresponds to Kupffer's epibranchial ganglia. Now it is clear
  that in the case of the vagus nerve, where, as is well shown in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the nerve is not
  a single segmental nerve, but is in reality made up of a number of nerves going to separate
  branchial segments, the indication of such segments is not given by the main vagus ganglion or
  neural ganglion, but by the series of lateral ganglia. So also it is argued in the case of the
  trigeminal, that if in addition to the ganglion-cells arising from the neural crest separate
  ganglion-masses are found in the course of development, in connection with proliferating patches
  of the surface (plakodes, Kupffer calls them), then such isolated lateral ganglia are indications
  of separate segments, just as in the case of the vagus, even though the separate segments do not
  show themselves in the adult. So far the argument appears to me just, but the further conclusion
  that the presence of such plakodes shows the previous existence of <i>branchial</i> sense-organs,
  and, therefore, that such ganglia are <i>epibranchial</i> ganglia, indicating the position of a
  lost gill-slit, is not justified by the premises. If, as I suppose, the trigeminal nerve supplied
  a series of non-branchial appendages serially homologous with the branchial appendages supplied by
  the vagus, then it is highly probable that the trigeminal should behave with respect to its
  sensory ganglia similarly to the vagus nerve, without having anything to do with branchi√¶.</p>

  <p>Such plakodal ganglia, then, may give valuable indication of non-branchial segments as well as
  of branchial segments. The researches of Kupffer on the formation of the trigeminal ganglia in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes are the chief attempt to find out from the side of the sensory ganglia the number
  of segments originally belonging to the trigeminal. The nature and result of these researches is
  described in my previous paper (<i>Journal of Anatomy and Physiology</i>, vol. xxxiv.), and it
  will suffice here to state that he himself concludes that the trigeminal originally supplied five
  at least, probably six, segments. As I have stated there, the evidence as given by him seems to me
  to indicate even as many as seven segments.</p>

  <p>In the full-grown Ammoc&#x0153;tes, as is well known, there are two distinct ganglia belonging
  to the trigeminal, the one the ganglion of the <i>ramus ophthalmicus</i>, the other the main
  ganglion.</p>

  <p>According to Kupffer the larval Ammoc&#x0153;tes possesses three sets of ganglia, not two, for
  between the foremost and hindmost ganglion <span class="pagenum" id="page283">{283}</span>he
  describes a nerve (<i>x.</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig113">113</a>), with four epibranchial ganglia,
  which do not persist as separate ganglia, but either disappear or are absorbed into the two main
  ganglia (Fig. <a href="#fig113">113</a>). This discovery of Kupffer's is very suggestive, for, as
  already stated, a transformation takes place when the Ammoc&#x0153;tes is 5 mm. long, so that the
  arrangement of the parts before that period is distinctly more indicative of the ancestral
  arrangement than any later one.</p>

  <p>If we use the name plakodal ganglia to represent that part of these ganglia which was
  originally connected with the skin, then Kupffer's researches assert that in the larval
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes there were seven such plakodal ganglia, one in front belonging to the foremost
  trigeminal ganglion, two behind, parts of the hindmost ganglion, and four in between, which do not
  exist later as separate ganglia.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the views put forward in this book, a possible interpretation of these
  plakodal ganglia would be given as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">Beard, who, after Froriep, drew attention to this relation of the cranial ganglia
  to special skin-patches, has compared them with the parapodial ganglia of annelids, <i>i.e</i>.
  ganglia in connection with annelidan appendages; whether we are here obtaining a glimpse of the
  far-off annelidan ancestry of both arthropods and vertebrates it would be premature at present to
  say. It is natural enough to expect, on my view, to find evidence of annelidan ancestry in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page284">{284}</span>vertebrate embryology (as has been so often asserted to
  be the case), seeing that undoubtedly the Arthropoda are an advanced stage of Annelida; and,
  indeed, the way is not a long one when we consider Beecher's evidence that the Trilobita belong to
  the Phyllopoda, certainly a primitive crustacean group, which Bernard derives directly from the
  annelid group Ch√¶topoda. If, then, these plakodal ganglia indicate the former presence of
  appendages, we obtain this result:&mdash;The foremost ganglion on each side possesses one plakodal
  ganglion, and therefore indicates an anterior pair of appendages, possibly the chelicer√¶. Then
  comes the peculiar nerve with four plakodal ganglia indicating on each side four appendages close
  together, possibly the endognaths. Then, finally, on each side, the second large ganglion with two
  plakodal ganglia, indicating two pairs of appendages, possibly the ectognaths and the
  metastoma.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>The consideration of the history of the cranial segmentation shows that whereas, from the
    commencement of that history, the evidence for two ventral segments supplied by the trigeminal
    nerve is clear and unmistakable, later observers have tended more and more to increase the
    number of these segments, until at the present time the evidence is in favour of at least six,
    probably seven, as the number of segments supplied by the motor part of the trigeminal.</p>
    <p>So, also, the original evidence for the number of dorsal or somatic segments limits the
    number to three, innervated respectively by the oculomotor (III.), trochlear (IV.), and abducens
    (VI.) nerves, or rather two, since the last nerve belongs to the facial segment. The muscles
    which these three nerves supply are derived respectively from the walls of the premandibular,
    mandibular, and hyoid c&#x0153;lomic cavities.</p>
    <p>Later evidence points strongly to the conclusion that the oculomotor nerve and the
    premandibular cavity represent not one segment but the fusion of four, while the mandibular
    cavity represents two segments. In addition to these, Miss Platt has discovered a still more
    anterior head-cavity, which she has named the anterior cavity, so that the pro-otic segments on
    this reckoning are seven in number, viz.: (1) the anterior cavity, (2, 3, 4, 5) the
    premandibular cavity, (6, 7) the mandibular cavity. The somatic muscles belonging to these
    dorsal segments are the eye-muscles, which are all dorso-ventral in position, and are not the
    same as the longitudinal somatic muscles, but belong to a distinct dorso-ventral segmental
    group, the only representative of which at present known in the mesosomatic region is the
    external rectus innervated by the VIth nerve.</p>
    <p>These head-cavities, and these muscles of the vertebrate, resemble the corresponding cavities
    and muscles of the invertebrate to an extraordinary <span class="pagenum"
    id="page285">{285}</span>degree, so that it becomes easy to see how the dorso-ventral muscles of
    the prosomatic segments of the latter have become converted into the eye-musculature of the
    former. The most powerful proof of all that such a conversion has taken place is that a natural
    and simple explanation is at once given of the extraordinary course taken by the IVth or
    trochlear nerve. Ever since neurology began, the course of this nerve has arrested the attention
    of anatomists. Why should just this one pair of nerve-roots of all those in the whole body be
    directed dorsalwards instead of ventralwards, and cross each other in the valve of Vieussens,
    each to supply a simple eye-muscle (the superior oblique) belonging to the other side? For
    generations anatomists have wondered and found no solution, and yet, without any straining of
    hypotheses, in consequence simply of the investigation of the anatomy of the corresponding pair
    of muscles in the scorpion group, the solution is immediately apparent.</p>
    <p>This pair of muscles alone, of all the musculature attached to the carapace, crosses the
    mid-dorsal line to be attached to the other side, thus carrying its nerve with it to the other
    side; by a continuation of the same process the relation of the trochlear to the superior
    oblique muscle can be explained.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The comparison of the eye-muscles of the vertebrate with the dorso-ventral
    segmented muscles of the invertebrate makes the number and nature of the pro-otic segments much
    clearer.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="sp3">In the last chapter it was seen not to be incompatible with both the anatomical and
  morphological evidence to look upon the trigeminal nerves as having originally supplied the seven
  prosomatic pairs of appendages of the invertebrate ancestor, the foremost of which, the chelicer√¶,
  and the four pairs of endognaths dwindled away and became insignificant, leaving as trace of their
  former presence the descending root of the Vth nerve; while the two hindmost pairs, the ectognaths
  and the chilaria, or metastoma, remained vigorous and developed, leaving as proof of their
  presence the <i>nucleus masticatorius</i>. Evidence in favour of this suggestion and of the nature
  of the dwindling process is afforded when we examine what the trigeminus does supply in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes. In all vertebrates this nerve supplies the great muscles of mastication which,
  in all gnathostomatous fishes, move the jaws. The lowest fishes, the cyclostomes, possess no jaws;
  they take in their food by attaching themselves to their prey and by means of rasping teeth
  situated in serried rows within the circular mouth, combined with a powerful suctorial apparatus,
  they suck the juices of the fish they feed upon. Not possessing jaws, they feed by suction on the
  living animal, a method of feeding which gives them no more claim to be classed as parasitic
  animals than the whole group of spiders which feed in a similar manner on living flies.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page287">{287}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Origin of the Suctorial Apparatus of Petromyzon.</span></p>

  <p>This powerful suctorial apparatus is innervated entirely by the trigeminal nerve, so that here
  in its muscular arrangements any original segmental arrangement of the muscles of mastication
  might be expected to be visible. It consists of a large rod or piston, to which are attached
  powerful longitudinal muscles; a large muscle, the basilar muscle, which assists the piston in
  producing a vacuum, and annular muscles around the circular lip.</p>

  <p>Turn now to the full-grown larval form, Ammoc&#x0153;tes, an animal in the case of
  <i>Petromyzon Planeri</i> as large as the full-grown Petromyzon, and seek for this musculature.
  There is, apparently, no sign of it, no suctorial apparatus whatever, only, as already mentioned,
  an oral chamber bounded by the lower and upper lips and the remains of the septum between it and
  the respiratory chamber&mdash;the velar folds. Attached to its walls a number of tentacles are
  situated, which form a fringe around and within the mouth. Most extraordinary is the contrast here
  between the larval and the adult stages; in the former, no sign of the suctorial apparatus, but
  simply tentacles and velar folds; in the latter, no sign of tentacles or of velar folds, but a
  massive suctorial apparatus.</p>

  <p>In order, then, to understand the origin of the muscles of mastication, it is necessary to
  study the changes which occur at transformation, and thus to find out how the suctorial apparatus
  of the adult arises. This most important investigation has been undertaken by Miss Alcock, and
  owing to the kindness of Mr. Millington, of Thetford, we have been able to obtain a better series
  in the transformation process than has ever been obtained before. Miss Alcock has not yet
  published her researches, but has allowed me to make use of some of her facts.</p>

  <p>An enormous proliferation of muscular tissue takes place with great rapidity during this
  transformation, which causes the disappearance of the tentacles, and gives origin to the suctorial
  apparatus. The starting point of this proliferation can be traced back in all cases to little
  groups of embryonic tissue found below the epithelial lining of the oral chamber in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes. Of these groups the most conspicuous one is situated at the base of the large
  median ventral tentacles. Others are situated at the base of the tentacular ridge. Further,
  although this extraordinary change takes place in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page288">{288}</span>peripheral organ, no marked difference occurs in the arrangement of the
  nerves issuing from the trigeminal motor centre, no new nerves are formed to supply the new
  muscles, but every motor nerve-fibre and the motor cell from which it arises increases enormously
  in size, and these giant nerve-fibres thus formed split into innumerable filaments corresponding
  with the proliferation of the muscular elements.</p>

  <p>The clue, then, to the origin of the suctorial apparatus and of the nature of the original
  organs supplied by the trigeminal is afforded in this case, as in all other similar inquiries, by
  the central nervous system and its outgoing nerves. Here is always the citadel, the fixed seat of
  government, here is 'headquarters,' from which the answers to all our inquiries must
  originate.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Trigeminal Nerve of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>Striking is the answer. In Fig. <a href="#fig114">114</a>, Miss Alcock has drawn the
  distribution of the trigeminal nerve as traced by her through a series of sections. It arises, as
  is well known, from two separate ganglia, of which the foremost gives rise to a purely cutaneous
  nerve, the ophthalmic nerve, and the hindmost to three nerves, the most posterior of which is
  purely cutaneous and passes tailwards over the ventral branchial region, as shown in the figure;
  the other two nerves, both <span class="pagenum" id="page289">{289}</span>of which contain motor
  fibres, are called by Hatschek the mandibular and maxillary nerves. Of these the mandibular or
  velar nerve (<i>met.</i>) is a large, conspicuous nerve, which arises so separately from the rest
  of the trigeminal as almost to deserve the title of a separate nerve. When it leaves the large
  posterior ganglion, it passes into the anterior part of the velum, runs along with the tubular
  muscles, which it supplies, to the ventral surface as far as the junction of the lower lip with
  the thyroid plate, and has not been followed further by Hatschek. Miss Alcock, however, by means
  of serial sections, has traced it further, and shown that at this point it turns abruptly
  headwards to terminate in the muscles of the lower lip. If, then, as suggested, the lower lip
  represents the metastoma&mdash;the last pair of prosomatic appendages&mdash;then this mandibular
  or velar nerve represents that segmental nerve.</p>

  <p>The other nerve&mdash;the maxillary nerve of Hatschek&mdash;which constitutes the larger part
  of the trigeminal, passes forwards from the ganglion, and at a point somewhere about the anterior
  region of the eyeball, divides into two, an external (<i>black</i> in Fig. <a
  href="#fig114">114</a>) and an internal (<i>red</i> in Fig. <a href="#fig114">114</a>) nerve. The
  external branch is apparently entirely sensory, and supplies the external surfaces of the upper
  and lower lips. The internal branch is mainly motor, and supplies the muscles of the upper lip; it
  contains also the nerves of the tentacles.</p>

  <p>The nerve to the median ventral tentacle (<i>t.</i>) or tongue leaves the internal division of
  the maxillary immediately after its separation from the external; it runs ventralwards, and at the
  same time passes internally until it reaches a position between the muco-cartilage and the
  epithelium lining the cavity of the throat. It then turns, and passing posteriorly (towards the
  tail) to the point where the median ventral tentacle is attached to the lower lip, it supplies
  some very rudimentary-looking muscles which run from the tentacle to the adjoining surface, and no
  doubt serve to move the tentacle from side to side. A portion of the nerve still continues to run
  along the side of the median ventral ridge, as far back as the point where the muscles of the
  hyoid segment pass round to the ventral side between the velum and the thyroid; in fact, this
  small nerve passes along the whole length of the median ventral ridge.</p>

  <p>This description shows that the trigeminal nerve divides itself into two groups: the one
  represented black in the figure, which is purely cutaneous and sensory, corresponding, in the
  main, according <span class="pagenum" id="page290">{290}</span>to my theory, to the epimeral
  nerves of Limulus; the other coloured red, which supplies muscles belonging to the visceral or
  splanchnic muscle-group, and contains also the nerves to the tentacles.</p>

  <p>This latter group, which is formed by two distinct well-defined nerves, viz. the mandibular and
  the internal branch of the maxillary, corresponds, according to my theory, to the amalgamated
  nerves of the prosomatic appendages, and is clearly divisible into three distinct
  nerves&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The lower lip-nerve or the metastomal nerve (<i>met.</i>).</p>

  <p>2. The tongue-nerve (<i>t.</i>).</p>

  <p>3. The nerve (<i>tent.</i>) to the upper lip and tentacles.</p>

  <p>Of these three pairs of nerves it is suggested that the first pair were derived from the nerves
  to the metastomal appendage. The second pair of nerves ought, on this theory, originally to have
  supplied the pair of appendages immediately in front of the metastoma&mdash;that is, the pair of
  ectognaths, and therefore the ventral pair of tentacles, known as the tongue, would represent the
  last remnant of these ectognaths. Similarly, the other tentacles would represent the endognaths,
  and therefore the third pair of nerves would represent the fused nerves to these concentrated
  endognaths, which, in the Eurypterids, stand aloof from the ectognaths.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Let us consider these three propositions separately. In the first place, have we
  any right to attribute segmental value to the mandibular nerve? What evidence is there of segments
  in this region in Ammoc&#x0153;tes?</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Segment of the Lower Lip, or Metastomal Segment.</span></p>

  <p>We have seen that in the branchial or mesosomatic region the segments corresponding to the
  mesosomatic appendages were mapped out by means of their supporting or skeletal structures, their
  segmental muscles, and their nervous arrangements, as well as by the arrangement of the branchi√¶.
  Similarly, the segments in front of the branchial region, corresponding to the prosomatic
  appendages, ought to be definable by the same means, although, owing to the absence of branchi√¶
  and the greater concentration in this region, the separate segments would probably not be so
  conspicuous.</p>

  <p>The last segment considered was the segment belonging to the VIIth nerve corresponding to the
  opercular appendages of the <span class="pagenum" id="page291">{291}</span>Eurypterid. The segment
  immediately in front of this is the next for consideration, viz. that corresponding to the
  chilarial appendages or metastoma; and as the basal part of this pair of appendages was fused with
  the basal part of the operculum, the one cannot be discussed without the other; therefore, the
  segment to which the lower lip belongs must be considered in connection with and not apart from
  the thyro-hyoid segments already dealt with.</p>

  <p>In Chapter V., p. <a href="#page188">188</a>, I stated that the supporting bars of the foremost
  mesosomatic segments, the thyro-hyoid segments, differed from the cartilaginous bars of the
  branchial segments, in that they were composed of muco-cartilage. Also in addition to the
  muco-cartilaginous skeletal bars, a ventral plate of muco-cartilage exists in Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  which covers over the thyroid gland.</p>

  <p>Similarly in the prosomatic segments the skeletal bars are composed of muco-cartilage and the
  ventral plate of muco-cartilage continues forward as the plate of the lower lip. It is of special
  interest, in connection with the segments indicated by such supporting structures, to find that
  this special tissue is entirely confined to the head-region, and disappears absolutely at
  transformation, thus indicating the ancestral nature of the segments marked out by its
  presence.</p>

  <p>This muco-cartilaginous skeleton is the key to the whole position, and requires, therefore, to
  be understood. It is of great importance, not only because it demonstrates the position of the
  segments in Ammoc&#x0153;tes which characterized its invertebrate ancestor, but also because it
  possesses a structure remarkably similar to that found in the head-plates of the most ancient
  fishes. For the present I will confine myself to the consideration of this muco-cartilaginous
  skeleton as evidence of the relationship of Ammoc&#x0153;tes to the Eurypterids, and in the next
  chapter will show how absolutely the same skeleton corresponds to that of the Cephalaspid√¶, so
  that Ammoc&#x0153;tes is really a slightly modified Cephalaspid, the larval form of which was
  Eurypterid in character.</p>

  <p>In Chapter IV., Figs. 63, 64, I have given a representation of the ventral and dorsal views of
  an Ammoc&#x0153;tes cut in half horizontally. Such a section shows with great clearness the series
  of branchial appendages with their segmental muscles and cartilaginous bars which form the
  branchial segments innervated by the IXth and Xth nerves, according to my view of the branchial
  unit. As is seen (Fig. 64 or 115), the skeletal bar of the hyoid or opercular appendage, which is
  clearly serially homologous with the other branchial bars, is composed of muco-cartilage, and not
  of cartilage. If we follow this series of horizontal sections nearer to the origin of the
  cartilaginous bars from the sub-chordal cartilaginous rod on each side of the notochord, we obtain
  a picture, as in Fig. <a href="#fig116">116</a>, in which each branchial segment is defined by the
  section of the branchial cartilaginous bar (<i>sk<sub>4</sub></i>, <i>sk<sub>5</sub></i>), by the
  section of the separate branchi√¶ (<i>br<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>br<sub>3</sub></i>), and by the
  separate segmental muscles arranged round each bar, these muscles being partly ordinary striated
  (<i>m<sub>4</sub></i>, <i>m<sub>5</sub></i>), partly tubular (<i>mt<sub>3</sub></i>,
  <i>mt<sub>4</sub></i>). The uppermost of these branchial segments shows the same arrangement;
  (<i>sk<sub>3</sub></i>) is the branchial skeletal bar, which is now composed of muco-cartilage,
  not cartilage; (<i>br<sub>1</sub></i>) is the branchi√¶ in the same situation as the others, but
  here composed of glandular rather than of respiratory epithelium, while the ordinary striated
  branchial muscles of this segment are marked as (<i>m<sub>3</sub></i>), being separated from the
  tubular muscles of the segment (<i>mt<sub>2</sub></i>), owing to the large size of the blood-space
  in which these latter muscles are lying. In front of this segment so defined we see again another
  well-marked skeletal bar (<i>sk<sub>2</sub></i>) of muco-cartilage, evidently indicating a similar
  segment anterior to the hyoid segment. In connection with this bar there are no branchi√¶, but
  again we see two sets of visceral muscles, the one ordinary striated, marked
  (<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>), and the other tubular, marked (<i>mt<sub>1</sub></i>). Here, then, the
  section indicates the existence of a segment of the same character as the posteriorly situated
  branchial segments but belonging to a non-branchial region&mdash;a segment which would represent a
  non-branchial appendage, the last, therefore, of the prosomatic appendages. Let us, then, follow
  <span class="pagenum" id="page295">{295}</span>out these two segmental muco-cartilaginous bars and
  their attendant muscles, and see to what sort of segments their investigation leads.</p>

  <p>The bar which comes first for consideration (<i>sk<sub>3</sub></i>) arises immediately behind
  the auditory capsule from the first branchial cartilage very soon after it leaves the sub-chordal
  cartilaginous ligament; the soft cartilage of the sub-chordal ligament ceases abruptly in its
  extension along the notochord at the place where the hard cartilage of the parachordal joins it,
  and in a sense it may be said to leave the notochord at this place and pass into the basal part of
  the first branchial bar. The most anterior continuation of this branchial system is this
  muco-cartilaginous bar (<i>sk<sub>3</sub></i>), which passes forward and ventralwards, being
  separated from the axial line by the auditory capsule (<i>cf.</i> Fig. 118, A, B, C). Its position
  is well seen in a sagittal section, such as Fig. <a href="#fig117">117</a>. It follows absolutely
  the line of the pseudo-branchial groove (<i>ps. br.</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig114">114</a>), and
  ventrally joins the plate of muco-cartilage which covers the thyroid gland. It forms a thickened
  border to this plate anteriorly, just as the branchial cartilaginous bars border it posteriorly.
  In fact, it behaves with respect to the hyoid segment in a manner similar to the rest of the
  cartilaginous bars with respect to their respective segments.</p>

  <p>It represents, although composed of muco-cartilage, the cartilaginous bar of the operculum in
  Limulus, which also forms the termination of the branchial cartilaginous system, as fully
  explained in Chapter III.; it may therefore be called the opercular bar.</p>

  <p>The next bar (<i>sk<sub>2</sub></i>) is extremely interesting, as we are now out of the
  branchial or mesosomatic region, and into the region corresponding to the prosoma. It starts from
  a cartilaginous projection made of hard cartilage, just in front of the auditory capsule, called
  by Parker the 'pedicle of the pterygoid'&mdash;a projection (<i>ped.</i>) which defines the
  posterior limit of the trabecul√¶ on each side, where they join on to the parachordals,&mdash;and
  winding round and below the auditory capsule, joins the opercular bar (<i>cf.</i> Fig. <a
  href="#fig118">118</a>), to pass thence into and form part of the muco-cartilaginous plate of the
  lower lip. In the section figured (Fig. <a href="#fig116">116</a>), this projection of hard
  cartilage is not directly continuous with (<i>sk<sub>2</sub></i>), owing to a slight curvature in
  the bar; the next few sections show clearly the connection between (<i>ped.</i>) and
  (<i>sk<sub>2</sub></i>), and consequently the complete separation by means of this bar of the
  hyoid segment from the segment in front.</p>

  <p>In the figures, the hard cartilage is coloured purple, the soft cartilage blue, and the
  muco-cartilage red, so that the position of this bar is well shown. This bar may be looked upon as
  bearing the same relation to the muco-cartilaginous plate of the lower lip as the opercular bar
  does to the muco-cartilaginous plate over the thyroid; and seeing that these two plates form one
  continuous ventral head-shield of muco-cartilage (Fig. <a href="#fig118">118</a>, B), and also
  that this bar fuses with the opercular bar, we may conclude that the segment represented by the
  lower lip is closely connected with the hyoid or opercular segments. In other words, if the lower
  lip arose from the metastoma, then this pair of skeletal bars might be called the metastomal bars,
  which formed the supporting skeleton of the last pair of prosomatic appendages and, as is likely
  enough, arose in connection with the posterior lateral horns of the plastron; these posterior
  lateral horns, like the rest of the plastron, would give rise to hard cartilage, and so form in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes the two lateral so-called pterygoid projections.</p>

  <p>In the branchial region the muscles which marked out each branchial segment were of two
  kinds&mdash;ordinary striated visceral muscles and tubular muscles. Of these the former
  represented the dorso-ventral muscles of the branchial appendages, while the latter formed a
  separate group of dorso-ventral muscles with a separate innervation which may have been originally
  the segmental veno-pericardial muscles so characteristic of Limulus and the scorpions. In Figs.
  116, 117, the grouping of these muscles in each branchial segment is well shown, and it is
  immediately seen that the hyoid segment possesses its group of striated visceral muscles
  (<i>m<sub>3</sub></i>) supplied by the VIIth nerve in the same manner as the posterior groups, as
  has already been pointed out by Miss Alcock in her previous paper. Passing to the segment in
  front, Fig. <a href="#fig116">116</a> shows that the group of visceral muscles
  (<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>) corresponds in relative position with respect to the metastomal bar to the
  hyoid muscles with respect to the opercular bar or to the branchial visceral muscles with respect
  to each branchial bar. What, then, is this muscular group? The series of sections show that these
  are the dorso-ventral muscles belonging to the lower lip, which, as seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig119">119</a> (<i>M.</i>), form a well-marked muscular sheet, whose fibres interlace
  across the mid-ventral line of the lower lip. This group of lower lip-muscles is very suggestive,
  for these muscles arise, not from the trabecul√¶, but from the front dorsal region of the cranium,
  just in front of the two lateral <span class="pagenum" id="page298">{298}</span>eyes. In Fig. <a
  href="#fig117">117</a> the dorsal part is seen cut across on its way to its dorsal attachment.
  Such an origin is reminiscent of the tergo-coxal group of muscles, arising, as they do, from the
  primordial cranium and the tergal carapace, and suggests at once that when the chilarial
  appendages expanded to form a metastoma, their tergo-coxal muscles formed a sheet of muscles
  similar to those of the lower lip of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, by which the movements of the metastoma
  were effected. The posterior limit of these muscles ventrally marks out the junction of the

  <p>Besides the striated visceral muscles, each branchial segment possesses its own tubular
  muscles, shown in Fig. <a href="#fig116">116</a> (<i>mt<sub>3</sub></i>) and
  (<i>mt<sub>4</sub></i>). As the section shows, there is clearly a group of tubular muscle-fibres
  belonging to the hyoid segment (<i>mt<sub>2</sub></i>), and also another group belonging to the
  segment in front of the hyoid (<i>mt<sub>1</sub></i>); so that, judging from this section, each of
  these segments possesses its own tubular musculature just as do the branchial segments, the
  difference being that the tubular muscles are more separated from the striated visceral group than
  in the true branchial segments, owing to the size of the blood-spaces surrounding them. What,
  then, are these two groups of muscles? Tracing them in the series of sections, both groups are
  seen to belong to the system of velar muscles, forming an anterior and a posterior group
  respectively; and we see, further, that there is not the slightest trace of any tubular muscles
  anterior to these muscles of the velum.</p>

  <p>In the living Ammoc&#x0153;tes the velar folds on each side can be seen <span class="pagenum"
  id="page299">{299}</span>to move synchronously with the movements of respiration, contracting at
  each expiration, and thus closing the slit by which the oral and respiratory chambers communicate,
  and so forcing the waters of respiration through the gill-slits, as described by Schneider. Such a
  fact is clear evidence that these tubular muscles of the velar folds belong to the same series as
  the tubular muscles of the branchial segments, so that if, as I have already suggested, the latter
  muscles were originally the veno-pericardial muscles of segments corresponding to the branchial
  appendages, then the former would represent the veno-pericardial muscles of the segments
  corresponding to the opercular and metastomal appendages. What, then, are these velar folds, and
  how is it that the tubular muscles of these two segments become the velar muscles? I will
  consider, in the first instance, the posterior group of muscles (<i>mt<sub>2</sub></i>) in Fig. <a
  href="#fig116">116</a>.</p>

  <p>It has already been pointed out that the tubular muscles of the branchial segments are
  dorso-ventral, but do not run with the ordinary constrictors, having separate attachments and
  running part of their course internally to and part externally to the ordinary constrictors. At
  first sight, as is usually stated, the hyoid segment does not appear to possess tubular muscles at
  all. If, however, we follow the posterior group of velar muscles (<i>mt<sub>2</sub></i>), we see
  (Fig. <a href="#fig117">117</a>) that they pass between the auditory capsule and the opercular bar
  (<i>sk<sub>3</sub></i>) of muco-cartilage to reach the region of the jugular vein (<i>j.v.</i>)
  posteriorly to the auditory capsule, so that their dorsal origin bears the same relation to the
  hyoid segment as the dorsal attachment of the rest of the tubular muscles to their respective
  segments. Further, these muscles run along the length of the velar fold, and are attached
  ventrally on each side of the thyroid gland, so that their ventral attachment also corresponds in
  position, as regards the hyoid segment, with the ventral attachment of the rest of the tubular
  muscles as regards their respective segments.</p>

  <p>This ventral attachment is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig119">119</a> on each side of the thyroid,
  and in Fig. <a href="#fig120">120</a> (<i>mt<sub>2</sub></i>); while in Fig. <a
  href="#fig117">117</a> the fibres are seen converging to this ventral position. In other words,
  this large posterior muscle of the velar folds is a dorso-ventral muscle, and would actually take
  the same position in the hyoid segment as the dorso-ventral tubular muscles in the other branchial
  segments, if the velum were put back into its original position as the septum terminating the
  branchial chamber. Conversely, the presence of these <span class="pagenum"
  id="page300">{300}</span>hyoid tubular muscles in the velum gives evidence that the opercular
  segment takes part in the formation of the septum, as already suggested.</p>

  <p>Miss Alcock, in her paper, speaks of tubular muscles belonging to the hyoid segment, which are
  attached to the muco-cartilage. Schaffer also speaks of certain tubular muscles belonging to the
  velar group as piercing the muco-cartilage (<i>h. r. s.</i>) in his figures 24 and 25, <i>i.e.</i>
  the metastomal bar, near its junction with the opercular bar. In my specimens there is a distinct
  group of tubular muscles which pierce the opercular bar of muco-cartilage at its junction with the
  metastomal bar, and pass into the posterior group of velar muscles. They clearly belong to the
  hyoid segment, as Miss Alcock supposed, but are not attached to the muco-cartilage. It is possible
  that they represent a different group to those already considered, and suggest the possibility
  that this opercular or thyro-hyoid segment is double with respect to its original veno-pericardial
  muscles as well as in other respects.</p>

  <p>The anterior group of tubular muscles (<i>mt<sub>1</sub></i>, Figs. 116, 117) belonging to the
  same segment as the metastomal bar must now be taken into consideration. Very different is their
  origin to that of the posterior group: they arise close up against the eye, and have given rise to
  Kupffer's and Hatschek's misconception that the superior oblique muscle of the eye arises from a
  part of the velar musculature. Naturally, as Neal has pointed out, they have nothing to do with
  the eye-muscles; the superior oblique muscle is plainly in its true place entirely apart from
  these velar muscles, which form the foremost group of the segmental tubular muscles. They pass
  into the anterior part of the velar folds and run round to the ventral side just in the same way
  as does the posterior group. This anterior group of tubular muscles represents the
  veno-pericardial muscle of the segment immediately in front of the opercular, <i>i.e.</i> the
  metastomal segment, and is the foremost of these veno-pericardial muscles. Its presence shows that
  the velar folds, formed as they were by the breaking down of the septum, are in reality part of
  two segments, viz. the opercular and the metastomal, which have fused together in their basal
  parts, and by such fusion have caused the inter-relationship between the VIIth and Vth nerves, so
  apparent in the anatomy of the vertebrate cranial nerves.</p>

  <p>A further piece of evidence that this anterior portion of the velum <span class="pagenum"
  id="page301">{301}</span>belongs to the same segment as the lower lip is the fact that in addition
  to the tubular muscles a single ordinary striated muscle is found in the velum which, like the
  muscles of the lower lip, is innervated by this same mandibular nerve.</p>

  <p>This muscle is attached laterally to the muco-cartilage of the metastomal bar
  (<i>sk<sub>2</sub></i>) at its junction with the muco-cartilage of the lower lip, and spreads out
  into a number of strands which are attached at intervals along the whole length of the free
  anterior edge of the velum. It is the only non-tubular muscle belonging to the velum, and by its
  contraction it draws the anterior portions of the velar folds apart from each other, and so opens
  the slit between them, through which the food and mud must pass. Clearly from its position it does
  not belong to the original tergo-coxal group of muscles as do those of the lower lip; it must have
  been one of the intrinsic muscles of the metastoma itself.</p>

  <p>This anterior portion of the velar folds affords yet another striking hint of the correctness
  of my comparison of the lower lip segment of Ammoc&#x0153;tes with the chilaria of Limulus or the
  metastoma of Eurypterus; for the most dorsal anterior portion, which at its attachment possesses a
  wedge of muco-cartilage, forms a separate, well-defined, rounded basal projection marked
  <i>Ser.</i> in Fig. <a href="#fig115">115</a>, and <i>B</i> in the accompanying Fig. <a
  href="#fig120">120</a>. This is that part of the velar folds which comes together in the middle
  line and closes the entrance into the respiratory chamber. The epithelial surface here is most
  striking and suggestive, for it is markedly serrated, being covered with a large number of
  closely-set projections or serr√¶. The serration of the surface here is of so marked a character
  that Langerhans considered this part of the velar folds to act as a masticating organ, grinding
  and rasping the food and mud which passed through the narrow slit. In fact, Langerhans supposed
  that this portion of the velum acted in a manner closely resembling the action of the gnatho-bases
  of the prosomatic appendages in Limulus or the Eurypterid√¶.</p>

  <p>This suggestion of Langerhans is surely most significant, considering that this somewhat
  separate portion of the velum, to which he assigns such a function, is in the very place where the
  gnathite portion of the metastomal appendages would have been situated if it were true that the
  lower lip and anterior portion of the velum of Ammoc&#x0153;tes were derived from the
  metastoma.</p>

  <p>In addition to this marked serrated edge the whole surface of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page302">{302}</span>the anterior portion of the velum is covered over with a scale-like or
  tubercular pattern remarkably like the surface-ornamentation seen in many of the members of the
  ancient group Eurypterid√¶. In Fig. <a href="#fig121">121</a> I give a picture of this
  surface-marking of the velum. It is striking to see that just as in the case of the invertebrate
  this marking and these serr√¶ are formed simply by the cuticular surface of the epithelial cells; a
  surface which, according to Wolff, possibly contains chitin. The interpretation which I would give
  of the velar folds is therefore as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>They represent the fused basal parts of the opercular and metastomal appendages, the
  gnatho-bases of the latter still retaining in a reduced degree their rasping surfaces, because,
  owing to their position on each side of the opening into the respiratory chamber they were still
  able to manipulate the food as it passed by them after the closure of the old mouth.</p>

  <p>The whole evidence points irresistibly to the conclusion that the mandibular or velar nerve of
  the trigeminal does supply a splanchnic <span class="pagenum" id="page303">{303}</span>segment
  which is, in all respects, comparable with the segments supplied by the facial, glossopharyngeal,
  and vagus nerves, except that it does not possess branchi√¶. This simply means that the appendages
  which these nerves originally supplied were prosomatic, not mesosomatic, and corresponded,
  therefore, to the chilarial or metastomal appendages.</p>

  href="#fig119">119</a>), when the thyroid gland and lower lip muscles have been exposed to view,
  enables the reader to recognize at a glance the correctness of this conclusion.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Tentacular Segments and the Upper Lip.</span></p>

  <p>Anterior to this metastomal segment, Fig. <a href="#fig116">116</a> shows a group of visceral
  muscles, <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>, and yet again a muco-cartilaginous bar, <i>sk<sub>1</sub></i>, but,
  as already stated, no tubular muscles. These visceral muscles indicate the presence in front of
  the lower lip-segment of one or more segments of the nature of appendages. The muscles in question
  (<i>m<sub>1</sub></i>) are the muscles of the upper lip, the skeletal elements form a pair of
  large bars of muco-cartilage (<i>sk<sub>1</sub></i>), which start from the termination of the
  trabecul√¶, and pass ventralwards to fuse with the muco-cartilaginous plate of the lower lip (Figs.
  117 and 118). This large bar forms the tentacular ridge on each side, and gives small projections
  of muco-cartilage into each tentacle. In addition to this tentacular bar, a special bar of
  muco-cartilage exists for the fused pair of median tentacles, the so-called tongue, which extends
  in the middle line along the whole length of the lower lip, being separated from the
  muco-cartilaginous plate of the lower lip by the muscles of the lower lip. This tongue bar of
  muco-cartilage joins with the muco-cartilage of the lower lip at its junction with the thyroid
  plate, and also with the tentacular bar just before the latter joins the muco-cartilaginous plate
  of the lower lip. This arrangement of the skeletal tissue suggests that the pair of tentacles
  known as the tongue stand in a category apart from the rest of the tentacles; a suggestion which
  is strongly confirmed by the separate character of its nerve-supply, as already mentioned.</p>

  <p>For three reasons, viz. the separateness both of their nerve-supply and of their skeletal
  tissue, and the importance they assume at transformation, this pair of ventral tentacles must, it
  seems to me, be put <span class="pagenum" id="page304">{304}</span>into a separate category from
  the rest of the tentacles. On the other hand, the innervation of the rest of the tentacles by a
  single nerve which sends off a branch as it passes each one, together with the concentration of
  their skeletal elements into a single bar, with projections into each tentacle, points directly to
  the conclusion that these tentacles must be considered as a group, and not singly.</p>

  <p>I suggest that these tentacles are the remains of the ectognaths and endognaths; the tongue
  representing the two ectognaths, and the four tentacles on each side the four pairs of
  endognaths.</p>

  <p>As we see, this method of interpretation attributes segmental value to the tentacles, a
  conclusion which is opposed to the general opinion of morphologists, who regard them as having no
  special morphological importance, and certainly no segmental value. On the other hand, the
  importance of the pair of ventral tentacles, the 'tongue' of Rathke, which lie in the mid-line of
  the lower lip, has been shown by Kaensche, Bujor, and others, all of whom are unanimous in
  asserting that at transformation they are converted into that large and important organ the piston
  or tongue of the adult Petromyzon. It is supposed that the rest of the tentacles vanish at
  transformation, being absorbed; they appear to me rather to take part in the formation of the
  sucking-disc, so that I am strongly inclined to believe that the whole of the remarkable suctorial
  apparatus of Petromyzon is derived from the tentacles of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. In other words, on my
  view, a conversion of the prosomatic appendages into a suctorial apparatus takes place at
  transformation, just as is frequently the case among the Arthropoda.</p>

  <p>It is to the arrangement of the muscles that we look for evidence of segmental value. As long
  as it was possible to look upon these tentacles as mere sensory feelers round the mouth entrance,
  it was natural to deny segmental value to them. Matters are now, however, totally different since
  Miss Alcock's discovery of the rudimentary muscles at the base of the tentacles and their
  development at transformation. If these muscles represent some of the appendage muscles belonging
  to the foremost prosomatic segments just as the ocular muscles represent the dorso-ventral somatic
  muscles of those same segments, then we may expect ultimately to be able to give as good evidence
  of segmentation in their case as I have been able to give in the case of these latter muscles; for
  the two sets of muscles are curiously alike, seeing that the eye-muscles do not develop until
  <span class="pagenum" id="page305">{305}</span>transformation, but throughout the Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  stage remain in almost as rudimentary a condition as the tentacular muscles.</p>

  <p>Another difficulty with respect to the tentacles is the determination of the number of them,
  owing to the fact that in addition to what may be called well-defined tentacles a large number of
  smaller tactile projections are found on the surface of the upper lip, as is seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig115">115</a>. In the very young condition, 7 or 8 mm. in length, it is easier to make
  sure on this point. At this stage they may be spoken of as arranged in two groups: an anterior
  small group and a posterior larger group. The anterior group consists of a pair of very small
  tentacles and a very small median tentacle, all three situated quite dorsally in the front part of
  the upper lip. The posterior group, which is separate from the anterior, consists of five pairs of
  much larger tentacles, the most ventral pair in the mid-line ventrally on the lower lip being
  fused together to form the large ventral median tentacle or tongue already mentioned. This pair,
  according to Shipley, is markedly larger than the others. There are, therefore, five conspicuous
  tentacles on each side, and in front of them a smaller pair and a small median dorsal one. In the
  very young condition the accessory projections above-mentioned are not present, or at all events
  are not conspicuous, and the tentacles are also markedly larger in comparison to the size of the
  animal than in the older condition, where they have distinctly dwindled.</p>

  <p>This posterior group of five conspicuous tentacles is the one which I suggest represents the
  four endognaths and one ectognath. What the significance of the small anterior group is, I know
  not. It is possible that the chelicer√¶ are represented here, for they are situated distinctly
  anterior to the other group; I know, however, of no sign of a markedly separate innervation to
  these most dorsal tentacles such as I should have expected to find if they represented the
  chelicer√¶.</p>

  <p>The muscles of the upper lip, which distinctly belong to the visceral and not to the somatic
  musculature, form part of the foremost segments, and in these muscles the tentacular nerve reaches
  its final destination. From their innervation, then, they must have belonged to the same
  appendages as the tentacles supplied by the tentacular nerve, <i>i.e.</i> to the endognaths. What
  conclusion can we form as to the probable origin of the upper lip of Ammoc&#x0153;tes? Since the
  oral chamber was formed by the forward growth of the metastoma, <i>i.e.</i> the lower lip of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, it follows that the upper <span class="pagenum" id="page306">{306}</span>lip is
  the continuation forwards of the original ventral surface of such an animal as Limulus or a member
  of the scorpion group, where there is no metastoma, and corresponds to the endostoma, as Holm
  calls it, of Eurypterus. This termination of the ventral surface in all these animals is made up
  of two parts: (1) Of sternites composing the true median ventral surface of the body, called by
  Lankester the pro- and meso-sternites; and (2) of the sterno-coxal processes of the foremost
  prosomatic appendages, called in the case of Limulus gnathites, because they are the main agents
  in triturating the food previously to its passage into the mouth. In Limulus, a conjoined
  pro-mesosternite forms the median ventral wall to which the sterno-coxal processes are attached on
  each side, and in Phrynus and Mygale a well-marked pro-sternite and meso-sternite are present,
  forming the posterior limit of the olfactory opening. In Buthus and the true scorpions the
  sterno-coxal processes of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th prosomatic appendages take part in surrounding the
  olfactory tubular passage; in Thelyphonus only the processes of the 2nd pair of prosomatic
  appendages play such a part, the pro-sternite not being present (<i>cf.</i> Fig. <a
  href="#fig97">97</a>).</p>

  <p>Seeing, then, what a large share the sterno-coxal processes of one or more of these prosomatic
  appendages plays in the formation of this endostoma, and seeing also that the nerve which supplies
  the upper lip-muscles in Ammoc&#x0153;tes is the same as that supplying the tentacles which are
  attached to the upper lip, it appears to me more probable than not that the muscles in question
  are the vestiges of the sterno-coxal muscles. These muscles differ markedly in their attachments
  from the muscles of the lower lip, for whereas the latter resemble the tergo-coxal group in their
  extreme dorsal attachment, the former resemble the sterno-coxal group in their attachment to what
  corresponds to the endostoma.</p>

  <p>This interpretation of the meaning of the transformation process is in accordance with all the
  previous evidence both from the side of the pal√¶ostracan as from the side of the vertebrate, for
  it signifies that a dwindling process has taken place in the foremost of the original prosomatic
  appendages&mdash;the chelicer√¶ and the endognaths; while, on the contrary, the ectognath and the
  metastoma have continued to increase in importance right into the vertebrate stage. This process
  is simply a continuation of what was already going on in the invertebrate stage, for whereas in
  Eurypterus and other cases <span class="pagenum" id="page307">{307}</span>the chelicer√¶ and
  endognaths had dwindled down to mere tentacles, the ectognath was the large swimming appendage,
  and the metastoma was on the upward grade from the two insignificant chilaria of Limulus.</p>

  <p>The transformation of these foremost appendages into a suctorial apparatus is very common among
  the arthropods, as is seen in the transformation of the caterpillar into the butterfly, and it is
  in accordance with the evidence that the main mass of that suctorial apparatus should be formed
  from appendages corresponding to the ectognath and metastoma rather than from the four endognaths.
  In all probability the <i>nucleus masticatorius</i> of the trigeminal nerve with its innervation
  of the great muscles of mastication is evidence of the continued development of the musculature of
  these two last prosomatic appendages, just as the descending root of the Vth demonstrates the
  further disappearance of all that belongs to the foremost prosomatic appendages. As yet, however,
  as far as I know, the musculature of the head-region of Petromyzon has not been brought into line
  with that of other vertebrates, and until that comparative study has been completed it is
  premature to discuss the exact position of the masticating muscles of the higher vertebrates.</p>

  <p>The analysis of these tentacular segments belonging to the trigeminal nerve presents greater
  difficulties than that of any of the other cranial segments, owing to the deficiency of our
  knowledge of what occurs at transformation. Light is required not only on the origin of the new
  muscles but also on the origin of the new and elaborate cartilages which are newly formed at this
  time.</p>

  <p>Miss Alcock has not yet worked out the origin of all these cartilages and muscles, so that we
  are not yet in a position to analyze the trigeminal supply in Petromyzon into its component
  appendage elements, an analysis which ought ultimately to enable us to determine from which
  appendage-muscles the masticating muscles in the higher vertebrates have arisen. As far as the
  muscles are concerned, she gives me the following information<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The tongue-nerve supplies in Ammoc&#x0153;tes the rudimentary muscles which pass laterally from
  the base of the large ventral tentacle to the wall of the throat, and even in Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  must possess some power of moving that tentacle.</p>

  <p>At transformation these muscles proliferate and develop enormously, and form the bulk of the
  large basilar muscle which <span class="pagenum" id="page308">{308}</span>surrounds the throat
  ventrally and laterally, and is the most bulky muscle in the suctorial apparatus.</p>

  <p>The velar or mandibular nerve supplies in Ammoc&#x0153;tes the muscles of the lower lip. In
  Petromyzon it supplies also the longitudinal muscles of the tongue. The tongue-cartilage first
  develops in the region of the median ventral tentacle, and there the longitudinal tongue-muscles
  first begin to develop, not from the rudimentary muscles in the tongue but from those in the lower
  lip region.</p>

  <p>In Ammoc&#x0153;tes the tentacular nerve supplies the rudimentary muscles in the tentacles and
  the muscles of the upper lip. The latter disappear entirely at transformation, and in Petromyzon
  the tentacular nerve supplies the circular, pharyngeal, and annular muscles, which are derived
  from the rudimentary tentacular muscles.</p>

  <p>For the convenience of my reader I append here a table showing my conception of the manner in
  which the endognathal and ectognathal segments of the Pal√¶ostracan are represented in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes. It shows well the uniform manner in which all the individual segmental factors
  have been fused together to represent the appearance of a single segment (van Wijhe's first
  segment) in the case of the four endognathal segments, but have retained their individuality in
  the case of the ectognathal segment.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Tubular Muscles.</span></p>

  <p>The only musculature innervated by the trigeminal nerve which remains for further discussion,
  consists of those peculiar muscles found in the velum, known by the name of striated tubular
  muscles. This group of muscles has already been referred to in Chapter IV., dealing with
  respiration and the origin of the heart.</p>

  <p>It is a muscular group of extraordinary interest in seeking an answer to the question of
  vertebrate ancestry, for, like the thyroid gland, it bears all the characteristics of a survival
  from a prevertebrate form, which is especially well marked in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. I have already
  suggested in this chapter that the homologues of these muscles are represented in Limulus by the
  veno-pericardial group of muscles. I will now proceed to deal with the evidence for this
  suggestion.</p>

  <p>The structure of the muscle-fibres is peculiar and very characteristic, so that wherever they
  occur they are easily recognized. Each fibre consists of a core of granular protoplasm, in the
  centre of which the nuclei are arranged in a single row. This core is surrounded by a margin of
  striated fibrill√¶, as is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig122">122</a>. Such a structure is
  characteristic of various forms of striated muscle found in various invertebrates, such as the
  muscle-fibre of mollusca. It is, as far as I know, found nowhere in the vertebrate kingdom, except
  in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. At transformation these muscles entirely disappear, becoming fattily
  degenerated and then absorbed.</p>

  <div class="ac w40 fcenter sp2">
    <a href="images/fig122.png" id="fig122"><img style="width:42%" src="images/fig122.png" alt=""

    <div class="smaller aj it1">
      <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Fig. 122.&mdash;A Tubular Muscle-fibre of
      Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>
      <p class="sp0">A, portion of fibre seen longitudinally; B, transverse section of fibre (osmic
      preparation); the black dots are fat-globules.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>For all these reasons they bear the stamp of a survival from a prevertebrate form. This alone
  would not make this tissue of any great importance, but when in addition these muscles are found
  to be arranged absolutely segmentally throughout the whole of the branchial region, then this
  tissue becomes a clue of the highest importance.</p>

  <p>As mentioned in Chapter IV., the segmental muscles of respiration consist of the adductor
  muscle and the two constrictor muscles&mdash;the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page310">{310}</span>striated constrictor and the tubular constrictor. Of these muscles, both
  the muscles possessing ordinary striation are attached to the branchial cartilaginous skeleton,
  whereas the tubular constrictors have nothing to do with the cartilaginous basket-work, but are
  attached ventrally in the neighbourhood of the ventral aorta.</p>

  <p>These segmental tubular muscles are found also in the velar folds&mdash;the remains of the
  septum or velum which originally separated the oral from the respiratory chamber. In the branchial
  region they act with the other constrictors as expiratory muscles, forcing the water out of the
  respiratory chamber. In the living Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the velar folds on each side can be seen to
  move synchronously with the movements of respiration, contracting at each expiration; they thus
  close the slit by which the oral and respiratory chambers communicate, and therefore, in
  conjunction with the respiratory muscles, force the water of respiration to flow out through the
  gill-slits, as described by Schneider.</p>

  <p>These tubular muscles thus form a dorso-ventral system of muscles essentially connected with
  respiration; they belong to each one of the respiratory segments, and are also found in the velum;
  anterior to this limit they are not to be found. What, then, are these tubular muscles in the
  velar folds? Miss Alcock has worked out their topography by means of serial sections, and, as
  already fully explained, has shown that they form exactly similar dorso-ventral groups, which
  belong to the two segments anterior to the purely branchial segments, <i>i.e.</i> to the facial or
  hyoid segments and the lower lip-segment of the trigeminal nerve. If the velar folds could be put
  back into their original position as a septum, then the hyoid or facial group of tubular muscles
  would take up exactly the same position as those belonging to each branchial segment.</p>

  <p>The presence of these two so clearly segmental groups of muscles in the velum&mdash;the one
  belonging to the region of the trigeminal, the other to the region of the facial&mdash;is strong
  confirmation of my contention that this septum between the oral and respiratory chambers was
  caused by the fusion of the last prosomatic and the first mesosomatic appendages, represented in
  Limulus by the chilaria and the operculum.</p>

  <p>Yet another clue to the meaning of these muscles is to be found in their innervation, which is
  very extraordinary and unexpected. Throughout the branchial region the striated muscles of each
  segment <span class="pagenum" id="page311">{311}</span>are strictly supplied by the nerve of that
  segment, and, as already described, each segment is as carefully mapped out in its innervation as
  it is in any arthropod appendage. One exception occurs to this orderly, symmetrical arrangement: a
  nerve arises in connection with the facial nerve, and passes tailwards throughout the whole of the
  branchial region, giving off a branch to each segment as it passes. This nerve (<i>Br. prof.</i>,
  Fig. <a href="#fig123">123</a>) is known by the name of the <i>ramus branchialis profundus</i> of
  the facial, and its extraordinary course has always aroused great curiosity in the minds of
  vertebrate anatomists. Miss Alcock, by the laborious method of following its course throughout a
  complete series of sections, finds that each of the segmental branches which is given off, passes
  into the tubular muscles of that segment (Fig. <a href="#fig124">124</a>). The tubular muscles
  which belong to the velum, <i>i.e.</i> those belonging to the lower lip-segment and to the hyoid
  segments, receive their innervation from the velar or mandibular nerve, and belong, therefore, to
  the trigeminal, not to the facial, system.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The evidence presented by these muscles is as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>In the ancestor of the vertebrate there must have existed a segmentally arranged set of
  dorso-ventral muscles of peculiar structure, concerned with respiration, and confined to the
  mesosomatic segments and to the last prosomatic segment, yet differing from the other
  dorso-ventral muscles of respiration in their innervation and their attachment.</p>

  <p>Interpreting these facts with the aid of my theory of the origin of vertebrates, and
  remembering that the homologue of the vertebrate ventral aorta in such a pal√¶ostracan as Limulus
  is the longitudinal <span class="pagenum" id="page312">{312}</span>venous sinus, while the
  opercular and chilarial segments are respectively the foremost mesosomatic and the last prosomatic
  segments; they signify that the pal√¶ostracan ancestor must have possessed a separate set of
  segmental dorso-ventral muscles confined to the branchial, opercular and chilarial or metastomal
  segments, which, on the one hand, were respiratory in function, and on the other were attached to
  the longitudinal venous sinus. Further, these muscles must all have received a nerve-supply from
  the neuromeres belonging to the chilarial and opercular segments, an unsymmetrical arrangement of
  nerves, on the face of it, very unlikely to occur in an arthropod.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page313">{313}</span></div>

  <p>Is this prophecy borne out by the examination of Limulus? In the first place, these muscles
  were dorso-ventral and segmental, and, referring back to Chapter VII., Lankester arranges the
  segmental dorso-ventral muscles in three groups: (1) The dorso-ventral somatic muscles; (2) the
  dorso-ventral appendage muscles; and (3) the veno-pericardial muscles. Of these the first group is
  represented in the vertebrate by the muscles which move the eye, the second group by the striated
  constrictor and adductor muscles and the muscles for the lower lip. There is, then, the
  possibility of the third group for this system of tubular muscles.</p>

  <p>Looking first at the structure of these muscles as previously described, so different are they
  in appearance from the ordinary muscles of Limulus, that Milne-Edwards, as already stated, called
  them "brides transparentes," and did not recognize their muscular character, while Blanchard
  called them in the scorpion, "ligaments contractils."</p>

  <p>Consider their attachment and their function. They are attached to the longitudinal sinus,
  according to Lankester's observation, in such a way that the muscle-fibres form a hollow cone
  filled with blood; when they contract they force this blood towards the gills, and thus act as
  accessory or branchial hearts. According to Blanchard, in the scorpion they contract synchronously
  with the heart; according to Carlson, in Limulus they contract with the respiratory muscles. In
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, where the respiration is effected after the fashion of Limulus, not of Scorpio,
  the tubular muscles are respiratory in function.</p>

  <p>Look at their limits. The veno-pericardial muscles in Limulus are limited by the extent of the
  heart, they do not extend beyond the anterior limit of the heart. In Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a>
  (p. <a href="#page176">176</a>) two of these muscles are seen in front of the branchial region
  also attached to the longitudinal venous sinus, although in front of the gill-region. In
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes the upper limit of the tubular muscles is the group found in the velum; this most
  anterior group belongs to a region in front of the branchial region&mdash;that of the
  trigeminal.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the supposition that the segmental tubular muscles belong throughout to the
  veno-pericardial group gives an adequate reason why they do not occur in front of the velum; for,
  as their existence is dependent upon the longitudinal collecting sinus in Limulus and Scorpio,
  which is represented by the ventral aorta in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page314">{314}</span>Ammoc&#x0153;tes, they cannot extend beyond its limits. Now, Dohrn
  asserts that the ventral aorta terminates in the spiracular artery, which exists only for a short
  time; and, in another place, speaking of this same termination of the ventral aorta, he states:
  "Dass je eine vorderste Arterie aus den beiden prim√§ren Aesten des Conus arteriosus hervorgeht,
  die erste Anlage der Thyroidea umfasst, in der Mesodermfalte des sp√§teren Velums in die H√∂he
  steigt um in die Aorta der betreffenden Seite einzumunden." These observations show that the
  vessel which in Ammoc&#x0153;tes represents the longitudinal collecting sinus in the Merostomata
  does not extend further forwards than the velum, and in consequence the representatives of the
  veno-pericardial muscles cannot extend into the segments anterior to the velum. One of the
  extraordinary characteristics of these tubular muscles which distinguishes them from other
  muscles, but brings them into close relationship with the veno-pericardial group, is the manner in
  which the bundles of muscle-fibres are always found lying freely in a blood-space; this is clearly
  seen in the branchial region, but most strikingly in the velum, the interior of which, apart from
  its muco-cartilage, is simply a large lacunar blood-space traversed by these tubular muscles.</p>

  <p>All these reasons point to the same conclusion: the tubular muscles in Ammoc&#x0153;tes are the
  successors of the veno-pericardial system of muscles.</p>

  <p>If this is so, then this homology ought to throw light on the extraordinary innervation of
  these tubular muscles by the <i>branchialis profundus</i> branch of the facial nerve and the velar
  branch of the trigeminal. We ought, in fact, to find in Limulus a nerve arising exclusively from
  the ganglia belonging to the chilarial and opercular segments, which, instead of being confined to
  those segments, traverses the whole branchial region on each side, and gives off a branch to each
  branchial segment; this branch should supply the veno-pericardial muscle of that side.</p>

  <p>Patten and Redenbaugh have traced out the distribution of the peripheral nerves in Limulus, and
  have found that from each mesosomatic ganglion a segmental cardiac nerve arises which passes to
  the heart and there joins the cardiac median nerve, or rather the median heart-ganglion, for this
  so-called nerve is really a mass of ganglion-cells. In all the branchial segments the same plan
  exists, each cardiac nerve belonging to that neuromere is strictly segmental. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page315">{315}</span>Upon reaching the opercular and chilarial neuromeres an
  extraordinary exception is found; the cardiac nerves of these two neuromeres are fused together,
  run dorsally, and then form a single nerve called the pericardial nerve, which runs outside the
  pericardium along the whole length of the mesosomatic region, and gives off a branch to each of
  the cardiac nerves of the branchial neuromeres as it passes them.</p>

  <p>This observation of Patten and Redenbaugh shows that the pericardial nerve of Limulus agrees
  with the very nerve postulated by the theory, as far as concerns its origin from the chilarial and
  opercular neuromeres, its remarkable course along the whole branchial region, and its segmental
  branches to each branchial segment.</p>

  <p>At present the comparison goes no further; there is no evidence available to show what is the
  destination of these segmental branches of the pericardial nerve, and so far all evidence of their
  having any connection with the veno-pericardial muscles is wanting. Carlson, at my request,
  endeavoured in the living Limulus to see whether stimulation of the pericardial nerve caused
  contraction of the veno-pericardial muscles, but was unable to find any such effect. On the
  contrary, his experimental work indicated that each veno-pericardial muscle received its motor
  supply from the corresponding mesosomatic ganglion. This is not absolutely conclusive, for if, as
  Blanchard asserts in the case of the scorpion, a close connection exists between the action of
  these muscles and of the heart, it is highly probable that their innervation conforms to that of
  the heart. Now Carlson has shown that this cardiac nerve from the opercular and chilarial
  neuromeres is an inhibitory nerve to the heart, while the segmental cardiac nerves belonging to
  the branchial ganglia are the augmentor nerves of the heart.</p>

  <p>His experiments, then, show that the motor nerves of the heart and of the veno-pericardial
  muscles run together in the same nerves, but he says nothing of the inhibitory nerves to the
  latter muscles. If they exist and if they are in accordance with those to the heart, then they
  ought to run in the pericardial nerve, and would naturally reach the veno-pericardial muscles by
  the segmental branches of the pericardial nerve.</p>

  <p>Moreover, inhibitory nerves are, in certain cases, curiously associated with sensory fibres; so
  that the nerve which corresponds <span class="pagenum" id="page316">{316}</span>to the pericardial
  nerve, viz. the <i>branchialis profundus</i> of the facial, may be an inhibitory and sensory
  nerve, and not motor at all. Miss Alcock's observations are purely histological; no physiological
  experiments have been made.</p>

  <p>At present, then, it does not seem to me possible to say that Carlson's experiments have
  disproved <i>any</i> connection of the pericardial nerve with the veno-pericardial muscles. We do
  not know what is the destination of its segmental branches; they may still supply the
  veno-pericardial muscles even if they do not cause them to contract; they certainly do not appear
  to pass directly into them, for they pass into the segmental cardiac nerves, and can only reach
  the muscles in conjunction with their motor nerves. Such a course would not be improbable when it
  is borne in mind how, in the frog, the augmentor nerves run with the inhibitory along the whole
  length of the vagus nerve.</p>

  <p>Until further evidence is given both as to the function of the segmental branches of the
  pericardial nerve in the Limulus, and of the <i>branchialis profundus</i> in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, it
  is impossible, I think, to consider that the phylogenetic origin of these tubular muscles is as
  firmly established as is that of most of the other organs already considered. I must say, my own
  bias is strongly in favour of looking upon them as the last trace of the veno-pericardial system
  of muscles, a view which is distinctly strengthened by Carlson's statement that the latter system
  contracts synchronously with the respiratory movements, for undoubtedly in Ammoc&#x0153;tes their
  function is entirely respiratory. Then again, although at present there is no evidence to connect
  the pericardial nerve in Limulus with this veno-pericardial system of muscles, yet it is
  extraordinarily significant that in such animals as Limulus and Ammoc&#x0153;tes, in both of which
  the mesosomatic or respiratory region is so markedly segmental, an intrusive nerve should, in each
  case, extend through the whole region, giving off branches to each segment. Still more striking is
  it that this nerve should arise from the foremost mesosomatic and the last prosomatic neuromeres
  in Limulus&mdash;the opercular and chilarial segments&mdash;precisely the same neuromeres which
  give origin to the corresponding nerve in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, for according to my theory of the
  origin of vertebrates, the nerves which supplied the opercular and metastomal appendages have
  become the facial nerve and the lower lip-branch of the trigeminal nerve.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page317">{317}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">With the formation of the vertebrate heart from the two longitudinal venous sinuses
  and the abolition of the dorsal invertebrate heart, the function of these tubular muscles as
  branchial hearts was no longer needed, and their respiratory function alone remained. The last
  remnant of this is seen in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, for the ordinary striated muscles were always more
  efficient for the respiratory act, and so at transformation the inferior tubular musculature was
  got rid of, there being no longer any need for its continued existence.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Pal√¶ostoma, or Old Mouth.</span></p>

  <p>The arrangement of the oral chamber in Ammoc&#x0153;tes is peculiar among vertebrates, and,
  upon my theory, is explicable by its comparison with the accessory oral chamber which apparently
  existed in Eurypterus. According to this explanation, the lower lip of the original vertebrate
  mouth was formed by the coalescence of the most posterior pair of the prosomatic
  appendages&mdash;the chilaria; from which it follows that the vertebrate mouth was not the
  original mouth, but a new structure due to such a formation of the lower lip.</p>

  <p>It is very suggestive that the direct following out of the original working hypothesis should
  lead to this conclusion, for it is universally agreed by all morphologists that the present mouth
  is a new formation, and Dohrn has argued strongly in favour of the mouth being formed by the
  coalescence of a pair of gill-slits. Interpret this in the language of my theory, and immediately
  we see, as already explained, gill-slits must mean in this region the spaces between appendages
  which did not carry gills; the mouth, therefore, was formed by the coalescence of a pair of
  appendages to form a lower lip just as I have pointed out.</p>

  <p>Where, then, must we look for the pal√¶ostoma, or original mouth? Clearly, as already suggested,
  it was situated at the base of the olfactory passage, and the olfactory passage or nasal tube of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes was originally the tube of the hypophysis, so that the following out of the
  theory points directly to the tube of the hypophysis as the place where the pal√¶ostoma must be
  looked for.</p>

  <p>This conclusion is not only not at variance with the opinions of morphologists, but gives a
  straightforward, simple explanation why the pal√¶ostoma was situated in the very place where they
  are most inclined to locate it. Thus, if we trace the history of the question, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page318">{318}</span>we see that Dohrn's original view of the comparison of
  the vertebrate and the annelid led him to the conception that the vertebrate mouth was formed by
  the coalescence of a pair of gill-slits, and that the original mouth was situated somewhere on the
  dorsal surface and opened into the gut by way of the infundibulum and the tube of the hypophysis.
  This, also, was Cunningham's view as far as the tube of the hypophysis was concerned. Beard, in
  1888, holding the view that the vertebrates were derived from annelids which had lost their
  supra-&#x0153;sophageal ganglia, and that, therefore, there was no question of an
  &#x0153;sophageal tube piercing the central nervous system of the vertebrate, explained the close
  connection of the infundibulum with the hypophysis by the comparison of the tube of the hypophysis
  with the annelidan mouth, so that the infundibular or so-called nervous portion was a special
  nervous innervation for the original throat, just as Kleinenberg had shown to be the case in many
  annelids. Beard therefore called this opening of the hypophysial tube the old mouth, or
  pal√¶ostoma. Recently, in 1893, Kupffer has also put forward the view that the hypophysial opening
  is the pal√¶ostoma. basing this view largely upon his observations on Ammoc&#x0153;tes and
  Acipenser.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig125">125</a>, the position of this pal√¶ostoma is a very
  suggestive one. At this single point in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, four separate tubes terminate; here is
  the end of the notochordal tube, the termination of the infundibulum, the blind end of the nasal
  tube or tube <span class="pagenum" id="page319">{319}</span>of the hypophysis, and the pre-oral
  elongation of the alimentary canal.</p>

  <p>It is perfectly simple and easy for the olfactory tube to open into any one of the other three.
  By opening into the infundibulum it reproduces the condition of affairs seen in the scorpion; by
  opening into the gut it produces the actual condition of things seen in Myxine and other
  vertebrates; by opening into the notochordal tube it would produce a transitional condition
  between the other two.</p>

  <p>The view held by Kupffer is that this nasal tube (tube of the hypophysis) opened into the
  anterior diverticulum of the vertebrate gut, and was for this reason the original mouth-tube; then
  a new mouth was formed, and this connection was closed, being subsequently reopened as in Myxine.
  My view is that this tube originally opened into the infundibulum, in other words, into the
  original gut of the pal√¶ostracan ancestor, and was for this reason the original mouth-tube, in the
  same sense as the olfactory passage of the scorpion may be, and often is, called the mouth-tube.
  When, with the breaking through of the septum between the oral and respiratory chambers, the
  external opening of the oral chamber became a new mouth, the old mouth was closed but the
  olfactory tube still remained, owing to the importance of the sense of smell. Subsequently, as in
  Myxine and the higher vertebrates, it opened into the pharynx, and so formed the nose of the
  higher vertebrates.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is not, to my mind, at all improbable that during the transition stage, between
  its connection with the old alimentary canal, as in Eurypterus or the scorpions, and its blind
  ending, as in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the nasal tube opened into the tube of the notochord. This
  question will be discussed later on when the probable significance of the notochord is
  considered.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Pituitary Gland.</span></p>

  <p>Turning back to the comparison of Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, B, and Fig. <a
  href="#fig106">106</a>, C, which represent respectively an imaginary sagittal section through an
  Eurypterus-like animal and through Ammoc&#x0153;tes at a larval stage, all the points for
  comparison mentioned on p. <a href="#page244">244</a> have now been discussed with the exception
  of the suggested homology between the coxal glands of the one animal and the pituitary body of the
  other.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page320">{320}</span></div>

  <p>This latter gland undoubtedly arises posteriorly to the hypophysial tube, or Rathke's pouch (as
  it is sometimes called), and, as already mentioned, is supposed by Kupffer to be formed from the
  posterior wall of this pouch. More recently, as pointed out in Haller's paper, Nusbaum, who has
  investigated this matter, finds that the glandular hypophysis is not formed from the walls of
  Rathke's pouch, but from the tissue of the rudimentary connection or stalk between the two
  premandibular cavities, which becomes closely connected with the posterior wall of Rathke's pouch,
  and becoming cut off from the rest of the premandibular cavity on each side, becomes permanently a
  part of the 'Hypophysis Anlage.'</p>

  <p>The importance of Nusbaum's investigation consists in this, that he derives the glandular
  hypophysis from the connecting stalk between the two premandibular cavities, and therefore from
  the walls of the ventral continuation of this cavity on each side.</p>

  <p>This may be expressed as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The c&#x0153;lomic cavity, known as the premandibular cavity, divides into a dorsal and a
  ventral part; the walls of the dorsal part give origin to the somatic muscles belonging to the
  oculomotor nerve, while the walls of the ventral part on each side form the connecting stalk
  between the two cavities, and give origin to the glandular hypophysis.</p>

  <p>Now, as already pointed out, the premandibular cavity is homologous with the 2nd prosomatic
  c&#x0153;lomic cavity of Limulus, and this 2nd prosomatic c&#x0153;lomic cavity divides, according
  to Kishinouye, into a dorsal and a ventral part; and, further, the walls of this ventral part form
  the coxal gland. Both in the vertebrate, then, and in Limulus, we find a marked glandular tissue
  in a corresponding position, and the conclusion is forced upon us that the glandular hypophysis
  was originally the coxal gland of the invertebrate ancestor. As in all other cases already
  considered, when the facts of topographical anatomy, of morphology and of embryology, all combine
  to the same conclusion as to the derivation of the vertebrate organ from that of the invertebrate,
  then there must be also a structural similarity between the two. What, then, is the nature of the
  coxal gland in the scorpions and Limulus? Lankester's paper gives us full information on this
  point as far as the scorpion and Limulus are concerned, and he shows that the coxal gland of
  Limulus differs markedly from that of Scorpio in the size of the cells and in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page321">{321}</span>arrangement of the tubes. In Fig. <a
  href="#fig126">126</a>, A, I give a picture of a piece of the coxal gland of Limulus taken from
  Lankester's paper.</p>

  <p>Turning now to the vertebrate, Bela Haller's paper gives us a number of pictures of the
  glandular hypophysis from various vertebrates, and he especially points out the tubular nature of
  the gland and its solidification in the course of development in some cases. In Fig. <a
  href="#fig126">126</a>, B, I give his picture of the gland in Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>The striking likeness between Haller's picture and Lankester's picture is apparent on the face
  of it, and shows clearly that the histological structure of the glands in the two cases confirms
  the deductions drawn from their anatomical and morphological positions.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The sequence of events which gave rise to the pituitary body of the vertebrate was in all
  probability somewhat as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Starting with the excretory glands of the Phyllopoda, known as shell-glands, which existed
  almost certainly in the phyllopod Trilobite, we pass to the coxal gland of the Merostomata.
  Judging from Limulus, these were coextensive with the cox√¶ of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th locomotor
  appendages. When these appendages became reduced in size and purely tactile they were compressed
  and concentrated round the mouth region, forming the endognaths of the Merostomata; as a necessary
  consequence of the concentration of the cox√¶ of the endognaths, the coxal gland also became
  concentrated, <span class="pagenum" id="page322">{322}</span>and took up a situation close against
  the pharynx, as represented in Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, B. When, then, the old mouth
  closed, and the pharynx became the <i>saccus vasculosus</i>, the coxal gland remained in close
  contact with the <i>saccus vasculosus</i>, and became the pituitary body, thus giving the reason
  why there is always so close a connection between the pituitary body and the infundibular
  region.</p>

  <p>Whatever was the condition of the digestive tracts at the transition stage between the
  arthropod and the vertebrate, the original mouth-opening at the base of the olfactory tube was
  ultimately closed. The method of its closure was exceedingly simple and evident. The membranous
  cranium was in process of formation by the extension of the plastron laterally and dorsally; a
  slight growth of the same tissue in the region of the mouth would suffice to close it and thus
  separate the infundibulum from the olfactory tube. As evidence that such was the method of
  closure, it is instructive to see how in Ammoc&#x0153;tes the glandular tissue of the pituitary
  body is embedded in and mixed up with the tissue of this cranial wall; how the termination of the
  nasal tube is embedded in this same thickened mass of the cranial wall&mdash;how, in fact, both
  coxal gland and olfactory tube have become involved in the growth of the tissue of the plastron,
  by means of which the mouth was closed.</p>

  <p>I have now passed in review the nature of the evidence which justifies a comparison between the
  segments supplied by the cranial nerves of the vertebrate and the prosomatic and mesosomatic
  segments of the pal√¶ostracan. For the convenience of my readers I have put these conclusions into
  tabular form (see p. 323), for all the segments as far as that supplied by the glossopharyngeal
  nerves. In both vertebrate and invertebrate this is a fixed position, for in the former, however
  variable may be the number of branchial segments which the vagus supplies, the second branchial
  segment is always supplied by a separate nerve, the glossopharyngeal, and in the latter, though
  the number of segments bearing branchi√¶ varies, the minimum number of such segments (as seen in
  the Pedipalpi) is never less than two.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>The general consideration of the evidence of the number of segments, and their nature in the
    pro-otic region of the vertebrate, as given in the last chapter, is not incompatible with the
    view that the trigeminal nerve originally supplied seven appendages, which appendages did not
    carry branchi√¶, but were originally used for purposes of locomotion as well as of
    mastication.</p>
    <p>Such appendages clearly no longer exist in the higher vertebrates, the muscles of mastication
    only remaining; but in the earliest fish-forms they must have existed, as, indeed, is seen in
    <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Ptericthys'.">Pterichthys</span> and
    Bothriolepis. Judging from all the previous evidence some signs of their existence may
    reasonably be expected still to remain in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. Such is indeed the case.</p>
    <p>In the adult Petromyzon the trigeminal nerve innervates specially a massive suctorial
    apparatus, by means of which it holds on to other fishes, or to stones in the bottom of the
    stream. There is here no apparent sign of appendages. Very great, however, is the difference in
    the oral chamber of Ammoc&#x0153;tes; here there is no sign of any suctorial apparatus, but
    instead, a system of tentacles, together with the remains of the septum or velum, which
    originally closed off the oral from the respiratory chamber. These tentacles are the last
    remnants of the original foremost prosomatic appendages of the pal√¶ostracan ancestor. Like the
    lateral eyes they do not develop until the transformation comes, but during the whole larval
    condition their musculature remains in an embryonic condition, and then from these embryonic
    muscles the whole massive musculature of the suctorial apparatus develops; a sucking apparatus
    derived from the modification of appendages, as so frequently occurs in the arthropods.</p>
    <p>The study of Ammoc&#x0153;tes indicates that the velum and lower lip correspond to the
    metastoma of the Eurypterid, <i>i.e.</i> the chilaria of Limulus, while the large ventral pair
    of tentacles, called the tongue, correspond to the ectognaths of the Eurypterids, and probably
    to the oar-like appendages of <span class="correction"
    title="Original reads 'Ptericthys'.">Pterichthys</span> and Bothriolepis. From these two
    splanchnic segments the suctorial apparatus in the main arises; the motor supply of these two
    segments forms the mass of the trigeminal nerve-supply, and the nerves supplying them, the velar
    nerve and the tongue-nerve, are markedly separate from the rest of the trigeminal nerve.</p>
    <p>The rest of the tentacles present much less the sign of independent segments. In their
    nerves, their muco-cartilaginous skeleton, and their rudimentary muscles, they indicate a
    concentration and amalgamation, such as might be expected from the concentrated endognaths. The
    continuation of the dwindling process, already initiated in the Eurypterid, would easily result
    in the tentacles of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>
    <p>The nasal tube of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, which originates in the hypophysial tube, corresponds
    absolutely in position and in its original structure, to the olfactory tube of a scorpion-like
    animal. From this homology two conclusions of importance follow: (1) the old mouth, or
    pal√¶ostoma, of the vertebrate was situated at the end of this tube, therefore, at the
    termination of the infundibulum; (2) the upper lip, which by its growth, brings the olfactory
    tube from a ventral to a dorsal position, was originally formed by the foremost sternites or
    endostoma, or else by the sterno-coxal processes of the second pair of prosomatic appendages of
    the pal√¶ostracan ancestor.</p>
    <p>In strict accordance with the rest of the comparisons made in this region, the pituitary body
    shows by similarity of structure, as well as of position, that it arose from the coxal glands,
    which were situated at the base of the four endognaths.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="page325">{325}</span></div>
    <p>One after another, when once the clue has been found, all these mysterious organs of the
    vertebrate, such as the pituitary and thyroid glands, fall harmoniously into their place as the
    remnants of corresponding important organs in the pal√¶ostraca.</p>
    <p>Yet another clue is afforded by the tubular muscles of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, that strange set of
    non-vertebrate striated muscles, which are so markedly arranged in a segmental manner, which
    disappear at transformation, and are never found in any of the higher vertebrates, for the
    limits of their distribution correspond to the veno-pericardial muscles of Limulus.</p>
    <p>Their nerve-supply in Ammoc&#x0153;tes is most extraordinary; for, although they are
    segmentally arranged throughout the whole respiratory region, which is segmentally supplied by
    the VIIth, IXth, and Xth nerves, and are found in front of this region only in one segment, that
    of the lower lip, which is supplied by the velar branch of the Vth nerve, yet they are not
    supplied segmentally, but only by the velar nerve and a branch of the VIIth, the <i>ramus
    branchialis profundus</i>. This latter nerve extends throughout the respiratory region, and
    gives off segmental branches to supply these muscles.</p>
    <p class="sp0">It is also a curious coincidence that in such a markedly segmented animal as
    Limulus, a nerve&mdash;the pericardial nerve&mdash;which arises from the nerves of the chilarial
    and opercular segments, should pass along the whole respiratory region and give off branches to
    each mesosomatic segment. It is strange, to say the least of it, that the chilarial or
    metastomal and the opercular segments of Limulus should, on the theory advocated in this book,
    correspond to the lower lip and hyoid segments of the vertebrate. At present the homology
    suggested is not complete, for there is no evidence as yet that the veno-pericardial muscles
    have anything to do with the pericardial nerve.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The shifting of the orifice of the olfactory passage, which led to the old mouth, from the
  ventral to the dorsal side, as seen in the transformation of the ventrally situated hypophysial
  tube of the young Ammoc&#x0153;tes, to the dorsally situated nasal tube of the full-grown
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, affords one of the most important clues in the whole of this story of the origin
  of vertebrates; for, if Ammoc&#x0153;tes is the nearest living representative of the first-formed
  fishes, then we ought to expect to find that the dorsal head-shield of such fishes is
  differentiated from that of the contemporary Pal√¶ostraca by the presence of a median frontal
  opening anterior to the eyes. Conversely, if such median nasal orifice is found to be a marked
  characteristic of the group, in combination with lateral and median eyes, as in Ammoc&#x0153;tes,
  then we have strong reasons for interpreting these head-shields by reference to the head of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The oldest known fishes belong to a large group of strange forms which inhabited
  the Silurian and Devonian seas, classed together by Smith Woodward under the name of Ostracodermi.
  These are divided into three orders: (1) the Heterostraci, including one family, the Pteraspid√¶,
  to which Pteraspis and Cyathaspis belong; (2) the Osteostraci, divisible into two families, the
  Cephalaspid√¶ and Tremataspid√¶, which include Cephalaspis, Eukeraspis, Auchenaspis or Thyestes, and
  Tremataspis; and (3) the Antiarcha, with one family, the Astrolepid√¶, including Astrolepis,
  Pterichthys, and Bothriolepis. <span class="pagenum" id="page327">{327}</span>Of these, the first
  two orders belong to the Upper Silurian, while the third is Devonian.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Dorsal Head-Shield of the Osteostraci.</span></p>

  <p>Of the three orders above-named, the Heterostraci and Osteostraci are the oldest, and among
  them the Cephalaspid√¶ have afforded the most numerous and best worked-out specimens. At
  Rootzik√ºll, in the island of &#x0152;sel, the form known as <i>Thyestes (Auchenaspis)
  verrucosus</i> is especially plentiful, being found thickly present in among the masses of
  Eurypterid remains, which give the name to the deposit. Of late years this species has been
  especially worked at by Rohon, and many beautiful specimens have been figured by him, so that a
  considerable advance has been made in our knowledge since Pander, Eichwald, Huxley, Lankester, and
  Schmidt studied these most interesting primitive forms.</p>

  <p>All observers agree that the head-region of these fishes was covered by a dorsal and ventral
  head-shield, while the body-region was in most cases unknown, or, as in Eichwald's specimens, and
  in the specimens figured in Lankester and Smith Woodward's memoirs, was made up of segments which
  were not vertebral in character, but formed an aponeurotic skeleton, being the hardened
  aponeuroses between the body-muscles. This body-skeleton, which possesses its exact counterpart in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, will be considered more fully when I discuss the origin of the spinal region of
  the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>Of the two head-shields, ventral and dorsal, the latter is best known and characterizes the
  group. It consists of a dorsal plate, with characteristic horns, which in <i>Thyestes
  verrucosus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig128">128</a>), as described by Rohon, is composed of two parts,
  a frontal part and an occipital part (<i>occ.</i>), the occipital part being composed of segments,
  and possessing a median ridge&mdash;the <i>crista occipitalis</i>. In Lankester's memoir and in
  Smith Woodward's catalogue, a large number of known forms are described and delineated, and we may
  perhaps say that in some of the forms, such as <i>Eukeraspis pustuliferus</i> (Fig. <a
  href="#fig127">127</a>, B), the frontal part of the shield only is capable of preservation as a
  fossil, while in Cephalaspis (Fig. <a href="#fig127">127</a>, A) not only the frontal part but a
  portion of the occipital region is preserved, the latter being small in extent when compared with
  the occipital region of Auchenaspis (Thyestes). Finally, in Tremataspis and Didymaspis, the whole
  of both frontal <span class="pagenum" id="page328">{328}</span>and occipital region is capable of
  preservation, the line of demarcation between these two regions being well marked in the latter
  species.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the best preserved specimens of all this group of fishes a frontal median orifice is always
  present; it appears in some specimens obscurely partially divided into two parts. Perhaps the best
  specimen of all was obtained by Rohon at Rootzik√ºll, and is thus described by him<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The frontal part of the dorsal head-plate carried (Fig. <a href="#fig128">128</a>) the two
  orbits for the lateral eyes (<i>l.e.</i>), a marked frontal organ (<i>fro.</i>), and a median
  depression (<i>gl.</i>), to which he gives the name parietal organ. The occipital part
  (<i>occ.</i>) was clearly segmented, and carried, he thinks, the branchi√¶. I reproduce Rohon's
  figure of the frontal organ in Thyestes (Fig. 129); he describes it as a deeply sunk pit, divided
  in the middle by a slit, which leads deeper in, he supposes, towards the central nervous
  system.</p>

  <p>A similar organ was described by Schmidt in Tremataspis, and considered by him to be a median
  nose. Such also is the view of Jaekel, who points out that a median pineal eye exists between the
  two lateral eyes in this animal, as in all other of these ancient fishes, so that this frontal
  organ does not, as Patten thinks, represent the pineal eye. The whole of this group of fishes,
  then, is characterized by the following striking characteristics<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1.  Two well-marked lateral eyes near the middle line.</p>

  <p>2.  Between the lateral eyes, well-marked median eyes, very small.</p>

  <p>3.  In front of the eye-region a median orifice, single.</p>

  <p>In addition, behind the eye-region a median plate is always found, frequently different in
  structure to the rest of the head-shield, being harder in texture&mdash;the so-called post-orbital
  plate.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Structure of Head-Shield of Cephalaspis compared with that of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>What is the structure of this head-shield? It has been spoken of as formed of bone because it
  possesses cells, being thus unlike the layers of chitin, which are formed by underlying cells but
  are not themselves cellular. At the same time, it is recognized on all sides that it has no
  resemblance to bone-structure as seen in fossil remains of higher vertebrates. The latest and best
  figure of the structure of this so-called bone is given in Rohon's paper already referred to. It
  is, so he describes, clearly composed of fibrill√¶ and star-shaped cells, arranged more or less in
  regular layers, with other sets of similar cells and fibrill√¶ arranged at right angles to the
  first set, or at varying angles. The groundwork of this tissue, in which these cells and fibrils
  are embedded, contained calcium salts, and so the whole tissue was preserved. In places, spaces
  are found in it, in the deepest layer large medullary spaces; more superficially, ramifying spaces
  which he considers to be vascular, and calls Haversian canals; the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page330">{330}</span>star-like cells, however, are not arranged concentrically around these
  spaces, as in true Haversian canals.</p>

  <p>This structure is therefore a calcareous infiltration of a tissue with cells in it. Where is
  there anything like it?</p>

  <p>As soon as I saw Rohon's picture (Fig. <a href="#fig130">130</a>), I was astounded at its
  startling resemblance to the structure of muco-cartilage as is seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig131">131</a>, taken from Ammoc&#x0153;tes. If such muco-cartilage were infiltrated with
  lime salts, then the muco-cartilaginous skeleton of Ammoc&#x0153;tes would be preserved in the
  fossil condition, and be comparable with that of Cephalaspis, etc.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The whole structure is clearly remarkably like Rohon's picture of a section of the
  head-plate of a Cephalaspid (Fig. <a href="#fig130">130</a>). In the latter case the matrix
  contains calcium salts, in the former it is composed of the peculiar homogeneous mucoid tissue
  which stains so characteristically with thionin. With respect to this calcification, it is
  instructive to recall the calcification in the interior of the branchial cartilages of Limulus, as
  described in Chapter III., for this example shows how easy it is to obtain a calcification in this
  chondro-mucoid material. With respect to the medullary spaces and smaller spaces in this tissue,
  as described by Rohon, I would venture to suggest that they need not all necessarily indicate
  blood-vessels, for similar spaces would appear in the head-shield of Ammoc&#x0153;tes if its
  muco-cartilage alone <span class="pagenum" id="page331">{331}</span>were preserved. Of these, some
  would indicate the position of blood-vessels, such, for instance, as of the external carotid which
  traverses this structure; but the largest and most internal spaces, resembling Rohon's medullary
  spaces, would represent muscles, being filled up with bundles of the upper lip-muscles.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Muco-Cartilaginous Head-Shield of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>The resemblance between the structure of the head-shield of Thyestes and the muco-cartilage of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, is most valuable, for muco-cartilage is unique, occurs in no other vertebrate,
  and every trace of it vanishes at transformation; it is essentially a characteristic of the larval
  form, and must, therefore, in accordance with all that has gone before, be the remnant of an
  ancestral skeletal tissue. The whole story deduced from the study of Ammoc&#x0153;tes would be
  incomplete without some idea of the meaning of this tissue. So also, as already mentioned, the
  skeleton of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is incomplete without taking this tissue into account. It is confined
  entirely to the head-region; no trace of it exists posteriorly to the branchial basket-work. It
  consists essentially of dorsal and ventral head-shields, connected together by the tentacular,
  metastomal, and thyroid bars, as already described. The ventral shield forms the
  muco-cartilaginous plate of the lower lip and the plate over the thyroid gland, so that the
  skeleton ventrally is represented by Fig. <a href="#fig118">118</a>, B, which shows how the
  cartilaginous bars of the branchial basket-work are separated from each other by this thyroid
  plate. At transformation, with the disappearance of this muco-cartilaginous plate, the bars come
  together in the middle line, as in the more posterior portion of the branchial basket-work.</p>

  <p>The dorsal head-shield of muco-cartilage covers over the upper lip, sends a median prolongation
  over the median pineal eyes and a lateral prolongation on each side as far as the auditory
  capsules, giving the shape of the head-shield of muco-cartilage, as in Fig. 118, C.</p>

  <p>Not only then is the structure of the head-shield of a Cephalaspid remarkably like the
  muco-cartilage of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, but also its general distribution strangely resembles that of
  the Ammoc&#x0153;tes muco-cartilage.</p>

  <p>Now, these head-shields in the Cephalaspid√¶ and Tremataspid√¶ <span class="pagenum"
  id="page332">{332}</span>vary very much in shape, as is seen by the comparison of Tremataspis and
  Auchenaspis with Cephalaspis and Eukeraspis, and yet, undoubtedly, all these forms belong to a
  single group, the Osteostraci.</p>

  <p>The conception that Ammoc&#x0153;tes is the solitary living form allied to this group affords a
  clue to the meaning of this variation of shape, which appears to me to be possible, if not indeed
  probable. There is a certain amount of evidence given in the development of Ammoc&#x0153;tes which
  indicates that the branchial region of its ancestors was covered with plates of muco-cartilage as
  well as the prosomatic region.</p>

  <p>The evidence is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The somatic muscles of Ammoc&#x0153;tes form a continuous longitudinal sheet of muscles along
  the length of the body, which are divided up by connective tissue bands into a series of imperfect
  segments or myotomes. This simple muscular sheet can be dissected off along the whole of the
  head-region of the animal, with the exception of the most anterior part, without interfering with
  the attachments or arrangements of the splanchnic muscular system in the least. The reason why
  this separation can be so easily effected is to be found in the fact that the two sets of muscles
  are not attached to the same fascia. The sheet of fascia to which the somatic muscles are attached
  is separated from the fascia which encloses the branchial cavity by a space (<i>cf.</i> Figs. 63
  and 64) filled with blood-spaces and cells containing fat, in which space is also situated the
  cartilaginous branchial basket-work. These branchial bars are closely connected with the branchial
  sheet of fascia, and have no connection with the somatic fascia, their perichondrium forming part
  of the former sheet. Upon examination, this space is seen to be mainly vascular, the blood-spaces
  being large and frequently marked with pigment; but it also possesses a tissue of its own,
  recognized as fat-tissue by all observers. The peculiarity of the cells of this tissue is their
  arrangement; they are elongated cells arranged at right angles to the plates of fascia, just as
  the fibres of the muco-cartilage are largely arranged at right angles to their limiting plates of
  perichondrium. These cells do not necessarily contain fat; and when they do, the fat is found in
  the centre of each cell, and does not push the protoplasm of the cell to the periphery, as in
  ordinary fat cells.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page333">{333}</span></div>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig132">132</a>, B, I give a specimen of this tissue stained by osmic acid;
  in Fig. <a href="#fig132">132</a>, A, I give a drawing of ordinary muco-cartilage taken from the
  plate of the lower lip; and in Fig. <a href="#fig133">133</a>, A, a modification of the
  muco-cartilage taken from the velum, which shows the formation of a tissue intermediate between
  ordinary muco-cartilage and this branchial fat-tissue.</p>

  <p>Further, in fully-grown specimens of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, in the region of undoubted
  muco-cartilage, a fatty degeneration of the cells frequently appears, together with an increase in
  the blood spaces,&mdash;the precursor, in fact, of the great change which overtakes this tissue
  soon afterwards, at the time of transformation, when it is invaded by blood, and swept away,
  except in those places where new cartilage is formed. I conclude, then, that the tissue of this
  vascular space was originally muco-cartilage, which has degenerated during the life of the
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes. The fact that in most cases undoubted muco-cartilage is to be found here and
  there in this space, is strong confirmation of the truth of this conclusion.</p>

  <p>If this conclusion is correct, we may expect that it would be confirmed by the embryological
  history of the tissue, and we ought to find that in much younger stages a homogeneous tissue of
  the same nature as muco-cartilage fills up the spaces in the branchial <span class="pagenum"
  id="page334">{334}</span>region, where in the Ammoc&#x0153;tes only blood and fat-containing cells
  are present. For this purpose Shipley kindly allowed me to examine his series of sections through
  the embryo at various ages. These specimens are very instructive, especially those stained by
  osmic acid, which preserves the natural thickness of this space better than other staining
  methods. At an age when the branchial cartilages are seen to be formed, when no fat-cells are
  present, a distinctive tissue (Fig. <a href="#fig133">133</a>, B) is plainly visible in the velum
  and at the base of the tentacles, in the very position where in the more advanced Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  muco-cartilage exists. Taking, then, this tissue as our guide, the specimens show that the space
  between the skin and the visceral muscles in which the cartilaginous basket-work lies is filled
  with a similar material. At this stage a sheet of embryonic tissue occupies the position where,
  later on, blood-spaces and fat-cells are found, and this tissue resembles that seen in the velum
  and other places where muco-cartilage is afterwards found.</p>

  <p>I conclude, therefore, that originally the branchial or mesosomatic region was covered with a
  dorsal plate of muco-cartilage, which carried on its under surface the dorsal part of the
  branchial basket-work, and sprang from the central core of skeletogenous tissue around the
  notochord; this plate was separated from the plate which covered this region ventrally by the
  lateral grove in which the gill-slits are situated. The ventral plate carried on its under surface
  the ventral part of the branchial basket-work, and was originally continuous with the plate over
  the thyroid gland.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig134">134</a>, A, B, C, the cranial skeleton of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is
  represented from the dorsal, ventral, and lateral aspects. The muco-cartilage is coloured red, the
  branchial or soft cartilage blue, and the hard cartilage purple. The degenerated muco-cartilage of
  the branchial region is represented as an uncoloured plate, on which the branchial basket-work
  stands in relief. If it were restored to its original condition of muco-cartilage, it would
  represent a uniform plate, on the <i>under</i> surface of which the basket-work would be situated;
  and if it were calcified and made solid, the branchial basket-work would not show at all in these
  figures.</p>

  <p>Is it possible to find the reason why this skeletal covering has degenerated so early before
  transformation, and why the thyroid plate remains intact until transformation? We see that all
  that part which has degenerated is covered over by the somatic muscles,&mdash;by, in fact, muscles
  which, being innervated by the foremost spinal nerves, belong naturally to the region immediately
  following the branchial. I suggest, therefore, that the original skeletal covering of
  muco-cartilage has remained intact only where it has not been invaded and covered over by somatic
  muscles, but has been invaded by blood and undergone the same kind of degenerative change as
  overtakes the great mass of this tissue at transformation wherever the somatic muscles have
  overgrown it.</p>

  <p>The covering somatic muscles in the branchial region form a dorsal and ventral group, of which
  the latter is formed in the embryo much later than the former, the line of separation between the
  two groups being the lateral groove, with its row of branchial openings. This groove ends at the
  first branchial opening, but the ventral and dorsal somatic muscles continue further headwards. It
  is instructive to see that, although the lateral groove terminates, the separation between the two
  groups of muscles is still marked out by a ridge of muco-cartilage, represented in Fig. <a
  href="#fig134">134</a>, A, which terminates anteriorly in the opercular bar.</p>

  <p>Passing now to the prosomatic region, we find that here, too, the muco-cartilaginous external
  covering is divisible into a dorsal and a ventral head-plate, the ventral head-plate being the
  plate of the lower lip, and the dorsal head-plate the plate of muco-cartilage over the front part
  of the head. The staining reaction with thionin maps out this dorsal head-plate in a most
  beautiful manner, and shows that the whole of the upper lip-region in front of the nasal orifice
  is one large plate of muco-cartilage, obscured largely by the invasion of the crossing muscles of
  the upper lip, but left pure and uninvaded all around the nasal orifice, and where the upper and
  lower lips come together. In addition to this foremost plate, a median tongue of muco-cartilage
  covers over the pineal eye and fills up the <span class="pagenum" id="page337">{337}</span>median
  depression between the two median dorsal somatic muscles. Also, two lateral cornua pass
  caudalwards from the main frontal mass of muco-cartilage over the lateral eyes, forming the
  well-known wedge which separates the dorsal and lateral portions of the dorso-lateral somatic
  muscle. In fact, similarly to what we find in the branchial region, the muco-cartilaginous
  covering can be traced with greater or less completeness only in those parts which are not covered
  by somatic muscles.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig134">134</a>, A, B, C, this striking muco-cartilaginous head-shield, both
  dorsal and ventral, is shown. Seeing that the upper lip wraps round the lower one on each side,
  and that this most ventral edge of the upper lip contains muco-cartilage, as is seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig117">117</a>, the dorsal head-shield of muco-cartilage ought, strictly speaking, to
  extend more ventrally in the drawings. I have curtailed it in order not to interfere with the
  representation of the lower lip and tentacular muco-cartilages.</p>

  <p>From what has been said, it follows that the past history of the skeletal covering of the whole
  head-region of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, both frontal and occipital, can be conjectured by means of the
  ontogenetic history of the foremost myomeres.</p>

  <p>Dohrn and all other observers are agreed that during the development of this animal a striking
  forward growth of the foremost somatic myomeres takes place, so that, as Dohrn puts it, the
  body-musculature has extended forwards over the gill-region, and at the same time the gill-region
  has extended backwards. It is therefore probable that in the ancestral form the myotomes,
  innervated by the first spinal nerves, immediately succeeded the branchial region. Judging from
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the forward growth was at first confined to the dorsal region, and therefore
  invaded the dorsal head-plate, the ventral musculature being distinctly a later growth. With
  respect to this dorsal part of the myotomes, the first myotome is originally situated some
  distance behind the auditory capsule, and then grows forward towards the nasal opening; the
  lateral part, according to Hatschek, grows forward more quickly than the dorsal part, and splits
  itself above and below the eye into a dorso-lateral part, which extends up to the olfactory
  capsule, and a ventro-lateral part (<i>m. lateralis capitis</i> anterior, superior, and inferior),
  thus giving rise to the characteristic appearance of the muco-cartilaginous head-shield of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>According, then, to the extent of the growth of these somatic <span class="pagenum"
  id="page338">{338}</span>muscles, the shape of the muco-cartilaginous head-shield will vary, and
  if it were calcified and then fossilized we should obtain fossil head-shields of widely differing
  configuration, although such fossils might be closely allied to each other. This is just what is
  found in this group. Let the muco-cartilage extend over the whole of the branchial region of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the resulting head-shield would be as in Fig. <a href="#fig135">135</a>, A; the
  branchial bars below the muco-cartilaginous shield might or might not be evident, and the line
  between the branchial and the trigeminal region might or might not be indicated. Such a
  head-shield would closely resemble those of Didymaspis and Tremataspis respectively. Now suppose
  the somatic musculature to encroach slightly on the branchial region and also laterally to the end
  of the anterior branchial region, then we should obtain a shape resembling that of Thyestes (Fig.
  <a href="#fig135">135</a>, B). Continue the same process further, the lateral muscle always
  encroaching further than the median masses, until the whole or nearly the whole branchial region
  is invested, and we get the head-shield of Cephalaspis (Fig. <a href="#fig135">135</a>, C);
  further still, that of Keraspis, and yet still further, that of Ammoc&#x0153;tes (Fig. <a
  href="#fig135">135</a>, D).</p>

  <p class="sp3">So close is this similarity, from the comparative point of view, between the dorsal
  head-shield of the Osteostraci and the dorsal cephalic region of Ammoc&#x0153;tes that it
  justifies us in taking Ammoc&#x0153;tes as the nearest living representative of such types; it is
  justifiable, therefore, to interpret by means of Ammoc&#x0153;tes the position of other organs in
  these forms. First and foremost is the hard plate <span class="pagenum"
  id="page339">{339}</span>known as the post-orbital plate, so invariably found. In Fig. <a
  href="#fig134">134</a>, C, I have inserted (<i>cr.</i>) the position of the membranous cranium of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and it is immediately evident that the primordial cranium of the Osteostraci
  must occupy the exact position indicated by this median hard plate. For this very reason this
  median plate would be harder than the rest in order to afford a better protection to the brain
  underneath. This plate, because of its position, may well receive the same name as the similar
  plate in the trilobite and various pal√¶ostracans and be called the glabellum.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Evidence of Segmentation in the Head-Shield&mdash;Formation of
  Cranium.</span></p>

  <p>We may thus conceive the position of the nose, lateral eyes, median eyes, and cranium in these
  old fishes. In addition, other indications of a segmentation in this head-region have been found.
  The most striking of all the specimens hitherto discovered are some of <i>Thyestes verrucosus</i>,
  discovered by Rohon, in which the dorsal shield has been removed, and so we are able to see what
  that dorsal shield covered.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig136">136</a>, I reproduce his drawing of one of his specimens from the
  dorsal and lateral aspects. These drawings show that the frontal part of the shield covered a
  markedly segmented part of the animal; five distinct segments are visible apart from the median
  most anterior region. This segmented region is entirely confined to the prosomatic region,
  <i>i.e.</i> to the region innervated by the trigeminal nerve. An indication of similar markings is
  given in Lankester's figure of <i>Eukeraspis pustuliferus</i> (see Fig. <a href="#fig127">127</a>,
  B), and, indeed, evidence of a segmentation under the antero-lateral border of the head-shield is
  recognized at the present time, not only in the Cephalaspid√¶, but also in the Pteraspid√¶, as was
  pointed out to me by Smith Woodward in the specimens at the British Museum. Also, in
  <i>Cyathaspis</i>, Jaekel has drawn attention to markings of a similar segmental nature (Fig. <a
  href="#fig137">137</a>).</p>

  <p>There seems, then, little doubt but that these primitive fishes possessed something in this
  region which was of a segmental character, and indicated at least five segments, probably
  more.</p>

  <p>Rohon entitles his discovery 'the segmentation of the primordial cranium.' It would, I think,
  be better to call it the segmentation of <span class="pagenum" id="page340">{340}</span>the
  anterior region of the head, for that is in reality what his figures show, not the segmentation of
  the primordial cranium, which, to judge from Ammoc&#x0153;tes, was confined to the region of the
  glabellum.</p>

  <p>What is the interpretation of this appearance?</p>

  <p>Any segmentation in the head-region must be indicative of segments belonging to the trigeminal
  or prosomatic region, or of segments belonging to the vagus or mesosomatic region. Many
  pal√¶ontologists, looking upon segmentation as indicative of gills and gill-slits, have attempted
  to interpret such markings as branchial segments, regardless of their position. As the figures
  show, they extend in front of the eyes and reach round to the front middle line, a position which
  is simply impossible for gills, but points directly to a segmentation connected with the
  trigeminal nerve. Comparison with Ammoc&#x0153;tes makes it plain enough that the markings in
  question are prosomatic in position, and that the gill-region must be sought for in the place
  <span class="pagenum" id="page341">{341}</span>where Schmidt and Rohon located it in Thyestes,
  viz. the so-called occipital region.</p>

  <p>This discovery of Rohon's is, in my opinion, of immense importance, for it indicates that, in
  these early fishes, the prosomatic segmentation, associated with the trigeminal nerve, was much
  more well-marked than in any fishes living in the present day. Why should it be more well-marked?
  Turning to the pal√¶ostracan, it is very suggestive to compare the markings on their prosomatic
  carapace with these markings. Again and again we find indications of segmentation in these fossils
  similar to those seen in the ancient fishes. Thus in Fig. <a href="#fig138">138</a> I have put
  side by side the pal√¶ostracan <i>Bunodes</i> and the fish <i>Thyestes</i>, both life size. In the
  latter I have indicated Rohon's segments; in the former the markings usually seen.</p>

  <p>From the evidence of Phrynus, Mygale, etc., as already pointed out, such markings in the
  pal√¶ostracan fossils would indicate the position of the tergo-coxal muscles of the prosomatic
  appendages, even though such appendages have not yet been discovered, and it is significant that
  in all these cases there is a distinct indication of a median plate or glabellum in addition to
  the segmental markings. Especially instructive is the evidence of Phrynus, as is seen by a
  comparison of Figs. 107 and 108, which shows clearly that this median plate (<i>glab.</i>) covered
  the brain-region, a brain-region which is isolated and protected from the tergo-coxal muscles by
  the growth dorsalwards of the flanges of the plastron. In this way an incipient cranium of a
  membranous character is formed, which helps to give attachment to these tergo-coxal muscles. As
  such cranium is derived directly from the plastron, it is natural that it should ultimately become
  cartilaginous, just as occurs when Ammoc&#x0153;tes becomes Petromyzon and the cartilaginous
  cranium of the latter arises from the membranous cranium of the former. In Galeodes also the
  growth dorsalwards of the lateral flanges of the plastron to form an incipient cranium in which
  the brain lies is very apparent.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page342">{342}</span></div>

  <p>I venture, then, to suggest that in the Osteostraci the median hard plate or glabellum
  protected a brain which was enclosed in a membranous cranium, very probably not yet complete in
  the dorsal region&mdash;certainly not complete if the median pineal eyes so universally found in
  these ancient fishes were functional&mdash;a cranium derived from the basal trabecul√¶, in
  precisely the same manner as we see it already in its commencement in Phrynus and other scorpions.
  With the completion of this cranium and its conversion into cartilage, and subsequently into bone,
  an efficient protection was afforded to the most vital part of the animal, and thus the hard
  head-shield of the Pal√¶ostraca and of the earliest fishes was gradually supplanted by the
  protecting bony cranium of the higher vertebrates.</p>

  <p>Step by step it is easy to follow in the mind's eye the evolution of the vertebrate cranium,
  and because it was evolved direct from the plastron, the impossibility of resolving it into
  segments is at once manifest; for although the plastron was probably originally segmented, as
  Schimk√©witsch thinks, all sign of such segmentation had in all probability ceased, before ever the
  vertebrates first made their appearance on the earth.</p>

  <p>It follows further, from the comparison here made, that those antero-lateral markings
  indicative of segments, found so frequently in these primitive fishes, must be interpreted as due
  not to gills but to aponeuroses, due to the presence of muscles which moved prosomatic appendages,
  muscles which arose from the dorsal region in very much the same position as do the muscles of the
  lower lip in Ammoc&#x0153;tes; the latter, as already argued, represent the tergo-coxal muscles of
  the last pair of prosomatic appendages&mdash;the chilaria or metastoma. Such an interpretation of
  these markings signifies that the first-formed fishes must have possessed prosomatic appendages of
  a more definite character than the tentacles of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, something intermediate between
  those of the pal√¶ostracan and Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p class="sp3">For my part I should not be in the least surprised were I to hear that something of
  the nature of appendages in this region had been found, especially in view of the well-known
  existence of the pair of appendages in the members of the Asterolepid√¶&mdash;large, oar-like
  appendages which may well represent the ectognaths.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page343">{343}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Relationship of the Ostracoderms.</span></p>

  <p>Of the three groups of fishes&mdash;the Heterostraci, the Osteostraci, and the
  Antiarcha&mdash;the last is Devonian, and therefore the latest in time of the three, while the
  earliest is the first group, as both Pteraspis and Cyathaspis have been found in lower levels of
  the Silurian age than any of the Osteostraci, and, indeed, Cyathaspis has been discovered in
  Sweden in the lower Silurian. This, the earliest of all groups of fishes, is confined to two forms
  only&mdash;Pteraspis and Cyathaspis,&mdash;for Scaphaspis is now recognized to be the ventral
  shield of Pteraspis.</p>

  <p>Hitherto a strong tendency has existed in the minds both of the comparative anatomist and the
  pal√¶ontologist to look on the elasmobranchs as the earliest fishes, and to force, therefore, these
  strange forms of fish into the elasmobranch ranks. For this purpose the same device is often used
  as has been utilized in order to account for the existence of the Cyclostomata, viz. that of
  degeneration. The evidence I have put forward is very strongly in favour of a connection between
  the cyclostomes and the cephalaspids, and agrees therefore with all the rest of the evidence that
  the jawless fishes are more ancient than those which bore jaws&mdash;the Gnathostomata.</p>

  <p>This is no new view. It was urged by Cope, who classified the Heterostraci, Osteostraci, and
  Antiarcha under one big group&mdash;the Agnatha&mdash;from which subsequently the Gnathostomata
  arose. Cope's arguments have not prevailed up to the present time, as is seen in the writings of
  Traquair, one of the chief authorities on the subject in Great Britain. He is still an advocate of
  the elasmobranch origin of all these earliest fishes, and claims that the latest discoveries of
  the Silurian deposits (<i>Thelodus Pagei</i>) and other members of the C&#x0153;lolepid√¶ confirm
  this view of the question.</p>

  <p>This view may be summed up somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Cartilaginous jaws would not fossilize, and the Ostracoderms may have possessed them.</p>

  <p>They may have degenerated from elasmobranchs just as the cyclostomes are supposed to have
  degenerated.</p>

  <p>Seeing that bone succeeds cartilage, the presence of bony shields in Cephalaspis, etc.,
  indicates that their precursors were cartilaginous, presumably elasmobranch fishes.</p>

  <p>Of these arguments the strongest is based on the supposed bony <span class="pagenum"
  id="page344">{344}</span>covering of the Osteostraci, with the consequent supposition that their
  ancestors possessed a cartilaginous covering. This argument is entirely upset, if, as I have
  pointed out, the structure of the cephalaspid shield is that of muco-cartilage and not of bone. If
  these plates are a calcified muco-cartilage, then the whole argument for their ancestry from
  animals with a cartilaginous skeleton falls to the ground, for muco-cartilage is the precursor not
  only of bone, but also of cartilage itself.</p>

  <p>The evidence, then, points strongly in favour of Cope's view that the most primitive fishes
  were Agnatha, after the fashion of cyclostomes, as is also believed by Smith Woodward, Bashford
  Dean, and Jaekel.</p>

  <p>Among living animals, as I have shown, the Limulus is the sole survivor of the pal√¶ostracan
  type, and Ammoc&#x0153;tes alone gives a clue to the nature of the cephalaspid, <i>i.e.</i> the
  osteostracan fish. Older than the latter is the heterostracan, Pteraspis, and Cyathaspis. Is it
  possible from their structure to obtain any clue as to the actual passage from the pal√¶ostracan to
  the vertebrate?</p>

  <p>Here again, as in the case of the Osteostraci, a relationship to the elasmobranch has been
  supposed, for the following reasons<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The latest discoveries in the Silurian and Devonian deposits have brought to light strange
  forms such as Thelodus and Drepanaspis, of which the latter from the Devonian must, according to
  Traquair, be included in the Heterostraci. It possessed, as seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig139">139</a>, large plates, after the fashion of Pteraspis, and also many smaller
  ones.</p>

  <p>The former, from the upper Silurian, belongs to the C&#x0153;lolepid√¶, and was covered over
  with shagreen composed of small scutes, after the fashion of an elasmobranch. Traquair suggests
  that Thelodus arose from the original elasmobranch stock; that by the fusion of scutes such a form
  as Drepanaspis occurred, and, with still further fusion, Pteraspis.</p>

  <p>There are always two ways of looking at a question, and it seems to me possible and more
  probable to turn the matter round and to argue that the original condition of the surface-covering
  was that of large plates, as in Pteraspis. By the subsequent splitting up of such plates,
  Drepanaspis was formed, and later on, by further splitting, the elasmobranch, Thelodus being a
  stage on the way to the formation of an elasmobranch, and not a backward stage from the
  elasmobranch towards Pteraspis.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page345">{345}</span></div>

  <p>This method of looking at the problem seems to me to be more in consonance with the facts than
  the reverse; for, as pointed out by Jaekel, the fishes with large plates are the oldest, and in
  Cyathaspis, the very oldest of all, the size of the plates is most conspicuous; he considers,
  therefore, this preconceived view that large plates are formed by the fusion of small ones must
  give way to the opposite belief.</p>

  <div class="ac w35 fcenter sp2">

  </div>

  <p>So also Rohon, as quoted by Traquair, who, in his first paper accepted Lankester's view that
  the ridges of the pteraspidian shield were formed by the fusion of a linear arrangement of numbers
  of placoid scales, suggests in his second paper that these ridges may have been the most primitive
  condition of the dermal skeleton of the vertebrate, out of which, by differentiation, the dermal
  denticles (placoid scales) of the selachian, as well as their modifications in the ganoids,
  teleosteans, and amphibians, have arisen.</p>

  <p>One thing is agreed upon on all sides; no sign of bone-corpuscles is to be found in this dermal
  covering of Pteraspis. In the deeper layers are large spaces, the so-called pulp-cavities leading
  into narrow canaliculi, the so-called dentine canals. The structure is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page346">{346}</span>looked upon as similar to that of the pulp and dentine canals of many
  fish-scales.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, this dermal covering of Pteraspis has been compared by Patten with the
  arrangement of the chitinous structure of certain parts of the external covering of Limulus, a
  comparison which to my mind presents a great difficulty. The chitin-layers in Limulus are
  <i>external</i> to the epidermal cells, being formed by them; the layers in Pteraspis which look
  like chitin must have been <i>internal</i> to the epidermal layer; for each vascular canal which
  passes from a pulp-cavity on its way to be distributed into the dentine canals of the ridge gives
  off short side branches, which open directly into the groove between the ridges. If these canals
  were filled with blood they could not possibly open directly into the open grooves between the
  ridges; these openings must, therefore, have been covered over with an epithelial layer which
  covered over the surface of the animal, and consequently the chitin-like structure must have been
  internal to the epidermis, and not external, as on Patten's view. The comparison of this structure
  with the dentine of fish-scales signifies the same thing, for in the latter the epidermis is
  external to the dentine-plates, the hard skeletal structure is in the position of the cutis, not
  of the cuticle.</p>

  <p>The position appears to me to be this: the dermal cranial skeleton of vertebrates, whether it
  takes the form of a bony skull or of the dorsal plates of a cephalaspid or a pteraspid is, in all
  cases, not cuticular, <i>i.e.</i> is not an external formation of the epidermal cells, but is
  formed in tissue of the nature of connective tissue underlying the epidermis. On the contrary, the
  hard part of the head-carapace of the pal√¶ostracan is an external formation of the epidermal
  cells.</p>

  <p>If, then, this tissue of Pteraspis is not to be looked upon as chitin, how can we imagine its
  formation? It is certainly not bone, for there are no bone-corpuscles; it is a very regular
  laminated structure resembling in appearance chitin rather than anything else.</p>

  <p>As in all cases of difficulty, turn to Ammoc&#x0153;tes and let us see what clue there is to be
  found there. The skin of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is peculiar among vertebrates in many respects. It
  consists of a number of epidermal cells, as in Fig. <a href="#fig140">140</a>, the varying
  function of which need not be considered here, covered over with a cuticular layer which is
  extraordinarily thick for the cuticle of a vertebrate skin; this cuticular layer is perforated
  with fine canaliculi, through which the <span class="pagenum" id="page347">{347}</span>secretion
  of the underlying cells passes, as is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig140">140</a>, A and B. This
  cuticle corresponds to the chitinous covering of the arthropod, and like it is perforated with
  canaliculi, and, according to Lwoff, possibly contains chitin. The epidermal cells rest on a thick
  layer of most striking appearance (Fig. <a href="#fig141">141</a>), for it resembles, in an
  extraordinary degree, when examined superficially, a layer of chitin; it is called the laminated
  layer, and is characterized by the extreme regularity of the lamin√¶. This appearance is due, as
  the observations of Miss Alcock show, to alternate layers of connective tissue fibres arranged at
  right angles to each other, each fibre running a straight course and possessing its own nucleus.
  Although the fibres in each layer are packed close together, they are sufficiently apart to form
  with the fibres of the alternate layers a meshwork rather than a homogeneous structure, and thus
  the surface view of this layer shows a regular network of very fine spaces through which
  nerve-fibres and fluid pass. This layer is easily dissolved in a solution of hypochlorite of soda,
  a fluid which dissolves chitin. Any one looking at Ammoc&#x0153;tes would say that the only part
  of its skin which resembles chitin is this laminated layer, and therefore the only part of its
  skin which would afford an indication of the nature of the skeleton of Pteraspis is this laminated
  layer, which belongs to the cutis, and not to the cuticle. Yet another significant peculiarity of
  this layer is its entire disappearance at transformation. Miss Alcock, in a research not yet
  published, has shown that this layer is completely broken up and absorbed at transformation; the
  cutis of Petromyzon is formed entirely anew, and no longer presents any regular laminated
  character, but resembles rather the sub-epidermal connective tissue layer of the skin of higher
  vertebrates. This laminated layer, then, just like the muco-cartilage, shows, by its complete
  disappearance at transformation, its ancestral character.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Very suggestive is the arrangement of the different skeletal <span class="pagenum"
  id="page348">{348}</span>tissues in the head-region of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. Fig. <a
  href="#fig141">141</a> represents a section through the head near the pineal eye. Most internally

  represented in the past ages, supposing they could be fossilized?</p>

      <i>d</i>, external cuticular layer.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The most internal layer <i>a</i>, by the formation of cartilage and then bone, represents the
  great mass of vertebrate fossils; the next layer <i>b</i>, by a process of calcification, as
  previously argued, represents the head-shield of the Osteostracan fishes; while the cuticular
  layer <i>d</i>, no longer thin, is the remnant of the Pal√¶ostracan head-carapace. Between these
  two layers, <i>b</i> and <i>d</i>, lies the laminated layer <i>c</i>. Intermediate to the
  Pal√¶ostracan and the Osteostracan comes the Heterostracan, with its peculiar head-shield&mdash;a
  head-shield whose origin is more easily conceivable as arising from something of the nature of the
  laminated layer than from any other structure represented in Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>My present suggestion, then, is this: the transition from the skeletal covering of the
  Pal√¶ostracan to that of the highest vertebrates was brought about by the calcification of
  successive layers from without inwards, all of which still remain in Ammoc&#x0153;tes and show how
  the external chitinous covering of the arthropod was gradually replaced by the deep-lying internal
  bony cranium of the higher vertebrates.</p>

  <p>In Ammoc&#x0153;tes the layer which represents the covering of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page349">{349}</span>Pal√¶ostracan has already almost disappeared. At transformation the layers
  representing the stage arrived at by the Heterostracan and the Osteostracan disappear; but the
  stage representing the higher vertebrates, far from disappearing, by the formation of cartilage
  reaches a higher stage and prepares the way for the ultimate stage of all&mdash;the formation of
  the bony cranium.</p>

  <p>So much for the evidence as to the nature of the structure of the head-shield of the
  Pteraspid√¶.</p>

  <p>It suggests that these fishes were covered anteriorly with armoured plates derived from the
  cutis layer of the skin, a layer which was specially thickened and very vascular, apparently, to
  enable respiration to be very largely, if not entirely, effected by the surface of the body. It is
  difficult to understand how the sea-scorpions breathed, and it is easy to see how the formation of
  ventral and dorsal plates enclosing the mesosomatic appendages may at the outset have hindered the
  action of the branchi√¶. The respiratory chamber, according to my view, had at first the double
  function of respiration and digestion. A new digestive apparatus was the pressing need at the
  time; it would, therefore, be of distinct advantage to remove, as much as possible, the burden of
  respiration from this incipient alimentary canal.</p>

  <p>What can be said as to the shape of these ancient forms of fishes? Certain parts of them are
  absolutely known, other parts are guesswork. They are known to have possessed a dorsal shield, a
  ventral shield formerly looked upon as belonging to a separate species, called Scaphaspis, and a
  spine attached to the dorsal shield. The rest of their configuration, as given in Smith Woodward's
  restoration (Fig. <a href="#fig142">142</a>) is guesswork; the fish-like body with its scales, the
  heterocercal tail, is based on the most insufficient evidence of something of the nature of scales
  having being found near the head-plates.</p>

  <p>The dorsal shield is characterized by a pair of lateral eyes situated on the edge of the
  shield, not as in Cephalaspis near the middle line. In the middle line, where the rostrum meets
  the large dorsal plate, median eyes were situated. But the slightest sign of any median single
  nasal opening, such as is so characteristic of the head-shield of the Osteostraci and of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes has never been discovered. The olfactory organ must have been situated on the
  ventral side as in the larval stage of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, or in the Pal√¶ostraca. Many of these
  head-shields are remarkably well preserved, <span class="pagenum" id="page350">{350}</span>and it
  is difficult to believe that an olfactory opening would not be seen if any such had existed, as it
  does in Thyestes.</p>

  <div class="ac w40 fcenter sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The difficulty of interpreting these types is the difficulty of understanding their method of
  locomotion; that is largely the reason why the spine has been placed as if projecting from the
  back, and a fish-like body with a heterocercal tail-fin added. If, on the contrary, the spine is a
  terminal tail-spine, then, as far as the fossilized remains indicate, the animal consisted of a
  dorsal shield, a ventral shield, and a tail-spine, to which must be added two apparently lateral
  pieces and a few scales. If the animal did not possess a flexible body with a tail-fin, but
  terminated in a rigid spike after the fashion of a Limulus-like animal, then it must have moved by
  means of <span class="pagenum" id="page351">{351}</span>appendages. At present we have not
  sufficient evidence to decide this question.</p>

  <p>That the animal crawled about in the mud by means of free appendages is by no means an
  impossible view, seeing how difficult it is to find the remains of appendages in the fossils of
  this far-back time, even when we are sure that they existed. Thus, for many generations, the
  appendages of trilobites, which occur in such countless numbers, and in such great variety of
  form, were absolutely unknown, until at last, in consequence of a fortunate infiltration by
  pyrites, they were found by Beecher preserved down to the minutest detail. Even to this day no
  trace of appendages has been found in such forms as Hemiaspis, Bunodes, Belinurus,
  Prestwichia.</p>

  <p>The whole question of the evidence of any prosomatic appendages in these ancient fishes is one
  of very great interest, and of late years has been investigated by Patten. It has long been known
  that forms such as Pterichthys and Bothriolepis possessed two large, jointed locomotor appendages,
  and Patten has lately obtained better specimens of Bothriolepis than have ever been found before,
  which show not only the general configuration of the fish, but also the presence of mandibles or
  gnathites in the mouth-region resembling those of an arthropod. These mandibles had been seen
  before (Smith Woodward), but Patten's specimens are more perfect than any previously described,
  and cause him to conclude that these ancient fish were of the nature of arthropods rather than of
  vertebrates.</p>

  <p>Patten has also been able to obtain some excellent specimens of the under surface of the head
  of Tremataspis, which, as evident in Fig. <a href="#fig143">143</a>, show the presence of a series
  of holes, ranging on each side from the mouth-opening, in a semicircular fashion towards the
  middle line. He considers that these openings indicate the attachments of appendages, in
  opposition to other observers, such as Jaekel, who look upon them as gill-slits. To my mind, they
  are not in the right position for gill-slits; they are certainly in a prosomatic rather than in a
  mesosomatic position, and I should not be at all surprised if further research justified Patten's
  position. So convinced is he of the presence of appendages in all these old forms, that he
  considers them to be arthropods rather than vertebrates, although, at the same time, he looks upon
  them as indicating the origin of vertebrates from arthropods. Here, perhaps, it is advisable to
  say a few words on Patten's attitude towards this question.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page352">{352}</span></div>

  <p>Two years after I had put forward my theory of the derivation of vertebrates from arthropods,
  Patten published, in the <i>Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science</i>, simultaneously with my
  paper in that journal, a paper entitled "The Origin of Vertebrates from Arachnids." In this paper
  he made no reference to my former publications, but he made it clear that there was an absolutely
  fundamental difference between our treatment of the problem; for he took the old view that of
  necessity there must be a reversal of surfaces in order that the internal organs should be in the
  same relative positions in the vertebrate and in the invertebrate. He simply, therefore,
  substituted Arachnid for Annelid in the old theory. Because of this necessity for the reversal of
  surfaces he discarded the terms dorsal and ventral as indicative of the surfaces of an animal, and
  substituted h√¶mal and neural, thereby hopelessly confusing the issue and making it often very
  difficult to understand his meaning.</p>

  <div class="ac w30 fcenter sp2">

      Tremataspis.</span> (After <span class="sc">Patten</span>.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He still holds to his original opinion, and I am still waiting to find out when the reversal of
  surfaces took place, for his investigations lead him, as must naturally be the case, to compare
  the dorsal (or, as he would call it, the h√¶mal) surface of Bothriolepis, of the Cephalaspid√¶, and
  of the Pteraspid√¶ with the dorsal surface of the Pal√¶ostraca.</p>

  <p>All these ancient fishes are, according to him, still in the arthropod stage, have not yet
  turned over, though in a peculiarly unscientific manner he argues elaborately that they must have
  swum on their back rather than on their front, and so indicated the coming reversal. Because they
  were arthropods they cannot have had a <span class="pagenum" id="page353">{353}</span>frontal
  nose-organ; therefore, Patten looks upon the nose and the two lateral eyes of the Osteostraci as a
  complex median eye, regardless of the fact that the median eyes already existed.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Every atom of evidence Patten has brought forward, every new fact he has
  discovered, confirms my position and makes his still more hopelessly confused. Keep the animal the
  right side uppermost, and the evidence of the rocks confirms the transition from the Pal√¶ostracan
  to the Cyclostome; reverse the surfaces, and the attempt to derive the vertebrate from the
  pal√¶ostracan becomes so confused and hopelessly muddled as to throw discredit on any theory of the
  origin of vertebrates from arthropods. For my own part, I fully expect that appendages will be
  found not only in the Cephalaspid√¶ but also in the Pteraspid√¶, and I hope Patten will continue his
  researches with increasing success. I feel sure, however, his task will be much simplified if he
  abandons his present position and views the question from my standpoint.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>The shifting of the nasal tube from a ventral to a dorsal position, as seen in
    Ammoc&#x0153;tes, is, perhaps, the most important of all clues in connection with the comparison
    of Ammoc&#x0153;tes to the Pal√¶ostracan on the one hand, and to the Cephalaspid on the other;
    for, whereas the exact counterpart of the opening of such a tube is always found on the dorsal
    head-shield in all members of the latter group, nothing of the kind is ever found on the dorsal
    carapace of the former group.</p>
    <p>The reason for this difference is made immediately evident in the development of
    Ammoc&#x0153;tes itself, for the olfactory tube originates as a ventral tube&mdash;the tube of
    the hypophysis&mdash;in exactly the same position as the olfactory tube of the Pal√¶ostracan, and
    later on in its development takes up a dorsal position.</p>
    <p>In fact, Ammoc&#x0153;tes in its development indicates how the Pal√¶ostracan head-shield
    became transformed into that of the Cephalaspid.</p>
    <p>In another most important character Ammoc&#x0153;tes indicates its relationship to the
    Cephalaspid√¶, for it possesses an external skeleton or head-shield composed of muco-cartilage,
    which is the exact counterpart of the so-called bony head-shield of the latter group; and still
    more strikingly the structure of the cephalaspidian head-shield is remarkably like that of
    muco-cartilage. In the one case, by the deposition of calcium salts, a hard external skeleton,
    capable of being preserved as a fossil, has been formed; in the other, by the absence of the
    calcium salts, a soft chondro-mucoid matrix, in which the characteristic cells and fibrils are
    embedded, distinguishes the tissue.</p>
    <p>The recognition that the head-shields of these most primitive fishes were not composed of
    bone, but of muco-cartilage, the precursor of both cartilage and bone, immediately clears up in
    the most satisfactory manner the whole <span class="pagenum" id="page354">{354}</span>question
    of their derivation from elasmobranch fishes; for the main argument in favour of the latter
    derivation is the exceedingly strong one that bone succeeds cartilage&mdash;not <i>vice
    vers√¢</i>&mdash;therefore, these forms, since their head-shield is bony, must have arisen from
    some other fishes with a cartilaginous skeleton, most probably of an elasmobranch nature.
    Seeing, however, that the structure of their shields resembles muco-cartilage much more closely
    than bone, and that Ammoc&#x0153;tes forms a head-shield of muco-cartilage closely resembling
    theirs, there is no longer any necessity to derive the jawless fishes from the gnathostomatous;
    but, on the contrary, we may look with certainty upon the Agnatha as the most primitive group
    from which the others have been derived.</p>
    <p>The history of the rocks shows that the group of fishes, Pteraspis and Cyathaspis, are older
    than the Cephalaspid√¶&mdash;come, therefore, phylogenetically between the Pal√¶ostraca and the
    latter group. In this group the head-shields are of a very different character, without any sign
    of any structure comparable with that of bone, and although they possessed both lateral and
    median eyes, there is never in any case any trace of a dorsal nasal orifice. Their olfactory
    passage, like that of the Pal√¶ostraca, must have been ventral.</p>
    <p>The remarkable comparison which exists between the head-shields of Ammoc&#x0153;tes and
    Cephalaspis, enables us to locate the position of the brain and cranium of the latter with
    considerable accuracy, and so to compare the segmental markings found in many of these fossils
    with the corresponding markings, found either in fossil Pal√¶ostraca or on the head-carapaces of
    living scorpions and spiders, such as Phrynus and Mygale. In all cases the cranial region was
    covered with a median plate, often especially hard, which corresponded to the glabellum of the
    trilobite; the growth of the cranium can be traced from its beginnings as the upturned lateral
    flanges of the plastron to the membranous cranium of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>
    <p>From such a comparison it follows that the segments, found in the antero-lateral region of
    the head-shield, were not segments of the cranium, but of parts beyond the region of the
    cranium, and from their position must have been segments supplied by the trigeminal nerve, and
    not by the vagus group; segments, therefore, which did not indicate gills and gill-slits, but
    muscles, innervated by the trigeminal nerve; muscles which, as indicated by the corresponding
    markings on the carapace of Phrynus, Mygale, etc., were the tergo-coxal muscles of the
    prosomatic appendages.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The discovery of the nature of these appendages in the Pteraspid√¶ and
    Cephalaspid√¶, as well as in the Asterolepid√¶ (Pterichthys and Bothriolepis), is a problem of the
    future, though in the latter, not only have the well-known oar-like appendages been long since
    discovered, but Patten has recently found specimens of Bothriolepis which throw light on the
    anterior masticating gnathite-like appendages which these ancient forms possessed.</p>

  <p>When speaking of the tripartite arrangement of the cranial nerves, an arrangement which gave
  the clue to the meaning of the cranial segments, I spoke of the trigeminal as supplying the
  sensory nerves to the skin in the head-region, and I compared this dorsal system of afferent
  nerves to the system of epimeral nerves in Limulus which supply the prosomatic and mesosomatic
  carapaces of Limulus with sensory fibres. I compared the ventral system of eye-muscle nerves with
  the system of nerves supplying the segmental dorso-ventral somatic muscles of the prosomatic
  region, and I compared the lateral system of mixed nerves with the nerves supplying the prosomatic
  and mesosomatic appendages of Limulus. I compared, also, the optic nerves and the olfactory nerves
  with the corresponding nerves in the same invertebrate group. My readers will see at once that one
  well-marked group of nerves&mdash;the auditory and lateral line system&mdash;has been entirely
  omitted up to the present, it has not even been mentioned in the scheme of the cranial segments; I
  have purposely reserved its consideration until now, because the organs these nerves supply,
  though situated in the skin, are of such a special character <span class="pagenum"
  id="page356">{356}</span>as to form a category by themselves. These nerves cannot be classed among
  the afferent nerves of the skin any more than the nerves of the optic and olfactory apparatus;
  they require separate consideration. A very extensive literature has grown up on the subject of
  this system of lateral line sense-organs and their innervation, the outcome of which is decisively
  in favour of this system being classed with the sense-organs supplied by the auditory nerve, so
  that in endeavouring to understand the position of the auditory nerve, we must always bear in mind
  that any theory as to its origin must apply to the system of lateral line nerves as well.</p>

  <p>Now, although the auditory apparatus is common to all vertebrates, the lateral line system is
  not found in any land-dwelling animals; it belongs essentially to the fishes, and is, therefore,
  an old system so far as concerns the vertebrate group. Its sense-organs are arranged along the
  lateral line of the fish, and, in addition, on the head-region in three well-marked lines known as
  the supra-orbital, infra-orbital, and mandibular line systems. These sense-organs lie in the skin
  in a system of canals, and are innervated by a special nervous system different to that
  innervating adjacent skin-areas. The great peculiarity of their innervation consists in the fact
  that their nerves all belong to the branchial system of nerves; no fibres arise in connection with
  the trigeminal, but all of them in connection with the facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves.
  In other words, although organs in the skin, their nerve-supply belongs to the lateral nervous
  system which supplies splanchnic and not somatic segments, a system which, according to the theory
  advanced in this book, originated in the nerves supplying appendages. The conclusion, therefore,
  is that in order to obtain some clue as to the origin of the sense-organs of this system in the
  assumed pal√¶ostracan ancestor, we must examine the mesosomatic appendages and see whether they
  possess any special sense-organs of similar function.</p>

  <p>Further, considering that the auditory organ is to be regarded as a specially developed member
  of this system, we must especially look for an exceptionally developed organ in the region
  supplied by the auditory nerve.</p>

  <p>The question of the origin of this system of lateral line sense-organs possesses a special
  interest for all those who attempt to obtain a solution of the origin of vertebrates, for the
  upholders of the view that the vertebrates have descended from annelids have always <span
  class="pagenum" id="page357">{357}</span>found its strongest support in the similarity of two sets
  of segmental organs found in annelids and vertebrates. On the one hand, great stress was laid upon
  the similarity of the segmental excretory organs in the two groups of animals, as will be
  discussed later; on the other, of the similarity of the segmentally arranged lateral
  sense-organs.</p>

  <p>These lateral sense-organs of the annelids have been specially described by Eisig in the
  Capitellid√¶, and, according to Lang, "there are many reasons for considering these lateral organs
  to be homologous with the dorsal cirri of the ventral parapodia of other Polych√¶ta, and in the
  family of the Glycerid√¶ we can follow, almost step by step, the transformation of the cirri into
  lateral organs." Eisig describes them in the thoracic prebranchial region as slightly different
  from those in the abdominal branchial region; in the latter region, the ventral parapodia are
  gill-bearing, so that these lateral organs are in the branchial region closely connected with the
  branchi√¶, just as is also the case in the vertebrates. It is but a small step from the
  gill-bearing ventral parapodia of the annelid to the gill-bearing appendages of the phyllopod-like
  protostracan; so that if we assume that this is the correct line along which to search for the
  origin of the vertebrate auditory apparatus, then, on my theory of the origin of the vertebrates
  from a group resembling the Protostraca, it follows that special sense-organs must have existed
  either on or in close connection with the branchial and prebranchial appendages of the
  protostracan ancestor of the vertebrates, which would form an intermediate link between the
  lateral organs of the annelids and the lateral and auditory organs of the vertebrates.</p>

  <p>Further, these special sense-organs could not have been mere tactile hairs, but must have
  possessed some special function, and their structure must have been compatible with that function.
  Can we obtain any clear conception of the original function of this whole system of
  sense-organs?</p>

  <p>A large amount of experimental work has been done to determine the function of the lateral line
  organs in fishes, and they have been thought at one time or another to be supplementary organs for
  equilibration, organs for estimating pressure, etc. The latest experimental work done by Parker
  points directly to their being organs for estimating slow vibrations in water in contradistinction
  to the quicker vibrations constituting sound. He concludes that surface wave-movements, whether
  produced by air moving on the water or <span class="pagenum" id="page358">{358}</span>solid bodies
  falling into the water, are accompanied by disturbances which are stimuli for the lateral line
  organs.</p>

  <p>One of these segmental organs has become especially important and exists throughout the whole
  vertebrate group, whether the animal lives on land or in water&mdash;this is the auditory organ.
  Throughout, the auditory organ has a double function&mdash;the function of hearing and the
  function of equilibration. If, then, this is, as is generally supposed, a specialized member of
  the group, it follows that the less specialized members must possess the commencement of both
  these functions, just as the experimental evidence suggests.</p>

  <p>In our search, then, for the origin of the auditory organ of vertebrates, we must look for
  special organs for the estimation of vibrations and for the maintenance of the equilibrium of the
  animal, situated on the appendages, especially the branchial or mesosomatic appendages; and,
  further, we must specially look for an exceptional development of such segmental organs at the
  junction of the prosomatic and mesosomatic regions.</p>

  <p>Throughout this book the evidence which I have put forward has in all cases pointed to the same
  conclusion, viz. that the vertebrate arose by way of the Cephalaspid√¶ from some arthropod, either
  belonging to, or closely allied to, the group called Pal√¶ostraca, of which the only living
  representative is Limulus. If, then, my argument so far is sound, the appendages of Limulus, both
  prosomatic and mesosomatic, ought to possess special sense-organs which are concerned in
  equilibration or the appreciation of the depth of the water, or in some modification of such
  function, and among these we might expect to find that somewhere at the junction of the prosoma
  and mesosoma such sense-organs were specially developed to form the beginning of the auditory
  organ.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Now, it is a striking fact that the appendages of Limulus do possess special
  sense-organs of a remarkable character, which are clearly not simply tactile. Thus Gegenbaur, as
  already stated, has drawn attention to the remarkable branchial sense-organs of Limulus; and
  Patten has pointed out that special organs, which he considers to be gustatory in function, are
  present on the mandibles of the prosomatic appendages. I myself, as mentioned in my address to the
  British Association at Liverpool in 1896, searched for some special sense-organ at the junction of
  the prosoma and mesosoma, and was rewarded by finding that that extraordinary adjunct to the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page359">{359}</span>last locomotor appendage, known as the flabellum, was an
  elaborate sense-organ. I now propose to show that all these special sense-organs are constructed
  on a somewhat similar plan; that the structure of the branchial sense-organs suggests that they
  are organs for the estimation of water pressures; that among air-breathing arthropods
  sense-organs, built up on a somewhat similar plan, are universally found, and are considered to be
  of the nature of auditory and equilibration organs; and, what is especially of importance, in view
  of the fact that the most prominent members of the Pal√¶ostraca were the sea-scorpions, that the
  remarkable sense-organs of the scorpions known as the pectens belong apparently to the same
  group.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Poriferous Sense-Organs of the Appendages in
  Limulus.</span></p>

  <p>On all the branchial appendages in Limulus, special sense-organs are found of a most
  conspicuous character. They form in the living animal bluish convex circular patches, the
  situation of which on the appendages is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>. These organs are
  not found on the non-branchial operculum. Gegenbaur, who was the first to describe them, has
  pointed out how the surface of the organ is closely set with chitinous goblets shaped as seen in
  Fig. <a href="#fig144">144</a>, A, which do not necessarily project free on the surface, but are
  extruded on the slightest pressure. Each goblet fits into a socket in the chitinous covering, and
  is apparently easily protruded by variations of pressure from within. The whole surface of the
  organ on the appendage is slightly bulged in the living condition, and the chitin is markedly
  softer here than in the surrounding part of the limb. Each of these organs is surrounded by a
  thick protection of strongly branching spines. On the surface of the organ itself no spines are
  found, only these goblets, so that the surface-view presents an appearance as in Fig. <a
  href="#fig144">144</a>, B. Each goblet possesses a central pore, which is the termination of a
  very fine, very tortuous, very brittle chitinous tubule (<i>ch.t.</i>), which passes from the
  goblet through the layers of the chitin into the subjacent tissue. The goblets vary considerably
  in size, a few very large ones being scattered here and there. The fine chitinous tubule is
  especially conspicuous in connection with these largest goblets. In the smaller ones there is the
  same appearance of a pore and a commencing tube, but I have not been able to trace the tube
  through the chitinous layers, as in the case of the larger goblets.</p>

  <p>Gegenbaur, in his picture, draws a straight tubule passing from every goblet among the fine
  canaliculi of the chitin. He says they are difficult to see, except in the case of the larger
  goblets. The tubule from the larger goblets is most conspicuous, and is in my sections always
  tortuous, never straight, as represented by Gegenbaur. A special branch of the appendage-nerve
  passes to these organs, and upon the fine branches of this nerve groups of ganglion-cells are
  seen, very similar in appearance to the groups described by Patten on the terminal branches of the
  nerves which supply the mandibular organs. At present I can see no mechanism by which the goblets
  are extruded or returned into place. In the case of the Capitellid√¶, Eisig describes retractor
  muscles by means of which the lateral sense-organs are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page361">{361}</span>brought below the level of the surface, and he imagines that the
  protrusion is effected by hydraulic means, by the aid of the vascular system. In the branchial
  sense-organs of Limulus there are no retractor muscles, and it seems to me that both retraction
  and protrusion must be brought about by alterations of pressure in the vascular fluids. Certainly
  the cavity of the organ is very vascular. If this be so, it seems likely enough that such an organ
  should be a very delicate organ for estimating changes in the pressure of the external medium, for
  the position of the goblets would depend on the relation between the pressure of the fluid inside
  the organ and that on the surface of the appendage. Whether the chitinous tubule contains a
  nerve-terminal or not I am unable to decide from my specimens, but, judging from Patten's
  description of the similar chitinous tubules belonging to the mandibular organs, it is most highly
  probable that these tubules also contain a fine terminal nerve-fibre.</p>

  <p>These organs, then, represent segmental branchial sense-organs, of which it can be said their
  structure suggests that they may be pressure-organs; but the experimental evidence is at present
  wanting.</p>

  <p>Passing now from the branchial to the prosomatic region, the first thing that struck me was the
  presence of that most conspicuous projection at the base of the last locomotor appendage, which is
  usually called the flabellum, and has been described by Lankester as an exopodite of this
  appendage. It is jointed on to the most basal portion of the limb (<i>cf.</i> Fig. <a
  href="#fig155">155</a>), and projects dorsally from the limb into the open slit between the
  prosomatic and mesosomatic carapace, as is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig145">145</a> (<i>fl.</i>). Of
  its two surfaces, the undermost is very convex and the uppermost nearly flat from side to side,
  the whole organ being bent, so that when the animal is lying half buried in sand, entirely covered
  over by the prosomatic and mesosomatic carapaces except along this slit between the two, the upper
  flat or slightly convex surface of the flabellum is exposed to any movement of water through this
  slit, and owing to its possessing a joint, the direction of the whole organ can be altered to a
  limited extent. The whole of this flat upper surface is one large sense-organ of a striking
  character, thus forming a great contrast to the convex under surface, which is remarkably free
  from tactile spines or special sense-organs.</p>

  <p>The nerve going to the flabellum is very large, almost as large as the nerve to the rest of the
  appendage, and the very large majority <span class="pagenum" id="page362">{362}</span>of the
  nerve-fibres turn towards the flat, uppermost side, where the sense-organ is situated. Between the
  nerve-fibres (<i>n.</i>) and the chitinous surface containing the special sense-tubes masses of
  cells (<i>gl.</i>) are seen, as in Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a>, apparently nerve-cells, which
  form a broad border between the nerve-fibres and the pigmented chitinogenous layer (<i>p.</i>). On
  the opposite side, nothing of the sort intervenes between the pigmented layer and the blood-spaces
  and nerve-fibres which constitute the central mass of the flabellum.</p>

  <p>At present I am inclined to look upon this mass of cells as constituting a large ganglion,
  which extends over the whole length and breadth of the upper surface of the flabellum. At the same
  <span class="pagenum" id="page363">{363}</span>time, my preparations are not sufficiently clear to
  enable me to trace out the connections of these cells, especially their connections with the
  special sense-organs.</p>

      chitin.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig148">148</a> I give a magnified representation of a section through three
  of these flabellar sense-organs. As is seen, the section divides itself into four zones: (1) the
  chitinous layer (<i>ch.</i>); (2) the layer of pigment (<i>p.</i>) and hypodermal cells; (3) the
  layer of ganglion-cells (<i>gl.</i>); and (4) the layer of nerve-fibres (<i>n.</i>) and
  blood-spaces (<i>bl.</i>). The chitinous layer is composed of the usual three zones of the Limulus
  surface&mdash;externally (Fig. <a href="#fig148">148</a>), a thin homogeneous layer, followed by a
  thick layer of chitin (3), in which the fine vertical tubules or canaliculi are well marked; the
  external portion (2) of this layer is differentiated from the rest by the presence of well-marked
  horizontal layers in addition to the canaliculi.</p>

  <p>In this chitinous layer the special sense-organs are found. They consist of a large tube which
  passes through all the layers of the chitin except the thin homogeneous most external layer. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page364">{364}</span>This tube is conical in shape, its base, which rests on
  the pigmented layer, being so large and the organs so crowded together that a section of the
  chitin across the base of the tubes gives the appearance of a honeycomb, the septa of which is all
  that remains of the chitin. This large tube narrows down to a thin elongated neck as it passes
  through the chitin, and then, at its termination, bulges out again into an oval swelling
  (<i>cap.</i>) situated always beneath the homogeneous most external layer of chitin. Within this
  tube a fine chitinous tubule (<i>ch. t.</i>) is situated similar to that seen in the branchial
  sense-organs; it lies apparently free in the tube, not straight, but sinuous, and it passes right
  through all the chitinous layers to open at the surface as a pore; in the last part of its course,
  where it passes through the most external layer (1) of chitin, it lies always at right angles to
  the surface.</p>

  <p>If the flabellum be stained with methylene blue and acid fuchsin, then all the canaliculi in
  the chitin show up as fine red lines, and present the appearance given in Fig. <a
  href="#fig148">148</a>, and it is seen that each of the terminations of the tubules is surrounded
  in the homogeneous layer of chitin by a thick-set circular patch of canaliculi which pass to the
  very surface of the chitin, while the canaliculi in other parts terminate at the commencement of
  the homogeneous layer and do not reach the surface. Further, the contents of the oval swelling,
  and, indeed, of the tube as a whole, are stained blue, the chitinous tubule being either unstained
  or slightly pink in colour. We see, then, that the chitinous tubule alone reaches the surface,
  while the large tube, which contains the tubule, terminates in an oval swelling, which often
  presents a folded or wrinkled appearance, as in Fig. <a href="#fig149">149</a> (see also Patten's
  Fig. 1, Plate I.). This terminal bulging of the tube is reminiscent of the bulging in the
  chitinous tubes of the lyriform organs of the Arachnida, as described by Gaubert, and of the
  poriferous chordotonal organs in insects, as described by Graber (see Fig. <a
  href="#fig150">150</a>). This terminal swelling is filled with a homogeneous refringent mass
  staining blue with methylene blue, in which I have seen no trace of a nucleus; through this the
  chitinous tubule makes its way without any sign of bulging on its part. Patten, in his description
  of the sense-organs on the mandibles of Limulus, which are evidently the same in structure as
  those on the flabellum, refers to this homogeneous mass as a coagulum. I doubt whether this is an
  adequate description; it appears to me to stain rather more <span class="pagenum"
  id="page365">{365}</span>readily than a blood-coagulum, yet in the sense of being structureless it
  resembles a coagulum.</p>

  <p>The enormous number of these organs crowded together over the whole flat surface of the
  flabellum produces a very striking appearance when viewed on the surface. Such a view presents an
  appearance resembling that of the surface-view of the branchial sense-organs; in both cases the
  surface is covered with a great number of closely set circular plaques, in the centre of each of
  which is seen a well-marked pore. The circular plaques in the case of the flabellum are much
  smaller than those of the branchial sense-organs, and clearly are not protrusible as in the latter
  organs, the appearance as of a plaque being due to the ring of thickly-set canaliculi round the
  central tubule, as already described. When stained with methylene blue, the surface view of the
  flabellum under a low power presents an appearance of innumerable circular blue masses, from each
  of which springs a fine bent hair, terminating in a pore at the surface. The blue masses are the
  homogeneous substance (<i>cap.</i>) of the bulgings seen through the transparent external layer of
  chitin, and the hairs are the terminal part of the chitinous tubules. Patten has represented their
  appearance in the mandibles in his Fig. 2, Plate I.</p>

  <p>The large tubes in the chitin alter in shape according to their position. Those in the middle
  of the sensory surface of the flabellum, in their course through the chitinous layers, are hardly
  bent at all; as they approach the two lateral edges of this surface, their long thin neck becomes
  bent more and more, the bending always being directed towards the middle of the surface (see Fig.
  <a href="#fig146">146</a>); in this way the chitinous tubules increase more or less regularly in
  length from the centre of the organ to the periphery. The large basal part of the conical tube
  contains, besides the chitinous tubule, a number of nuclei which are confined to this part of the
  tube; some of these nuclei look like those belonging to nerve-fibres, others are apparently the
  nuclei of the chitinogenous membrane lining the tube. I have never seen any sign of nerve-cells in
  the tube itself.</p>

  <p>The only other kind of sense-organ I have found in connection with these sense-organs are a few
  spike-like projections, the appearance of which is given in Fig. <a href="#fig149">149</a>. I have
  always seen these in the position given in Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a> (<i>sp.</i>),
  <i>i.e.</i> at the junction of the surface which contains the sense-organs and the surface which
  is free from them. They are, so far as I have seen, not very numerous; I have <span
  class="pagenum" id="page366">{366}</span>not, however, attempted to examine the whole sense-organ
  for the purpose of estimating their number and arrangement.</p>

  <p>As is seen in Fig. <a href="#fig149">149</a>, they possess a fine tubule of the same character
  as that of the neighbouring sense-organs, which apparently terminates at the apex of the
  projecting spike. They appear to belong to the same group as the other poriferous sense-organs,
  and are of special interest, because in their appearance they form a link between the latter and
  the poriferous sense-organs which characterize the pecten of the scorpion (<i>cf.</i> Fig. <a
  href="#fig152">152</a>, C).</p>

  <p>Such, then, is the structure of this remarkable sense-organ of the flabellum, as far as I have
  been able to work it out with the materials at my disposal. It is evident that the flabellar
  organs, apart from the spike-organs, are of the same kind as those described by Patten on the
  mandibles and chel√¶ of Limulus, and therefore it is most probable that the nerve-terminals in the
  chitinous tubules, and the origin of the latter, are similar in the two sets of organs.</p>

  <p>These organs, as Patten has described them, are situated in lines on the spines of the
  mandibles of the prosomatic locomotor appendages, and are grouped closely together to form a
  compact sense-organ on the surface of the inner mandible (Lankester's epicoxite) (<i>i.m.</i> in
  Fig. <a href="#fig155">155</a>), so that a surface-view of the organ here gives the characteristic
  appearance of these poriferous sense-patches. Precisely similar organs are found on the chilaria,
  which are, in function at all events, simply isolated mandibles, to use Patten's terminology.</p>

  <p>On the digging appendage (ectognath), as the comparison of Fig. <a href="#fig155">155</a>, A
  and C, shows, the mandibular spines are almost non-existent, and the inner mandible or epicoxite
  is not present, so that <span class="pagenum" id="page367">{367}</span>the special sense-organ of
  this appendage is represented solely by the flabellum.</p>

  <p>This sketch of the special sense-organs of Limulus shows that all the appendages of Limulus
  possess special sense-organs, with the exception of the operculum. All these sense-organs are
  formed on the same plan, in that they possess a fine chitinous tubule passing through the layers
  of chitin into the underlying hypodermal and nervous tissues, which terminates on the surface in a
  pore. The surface of the chitin where these pores are situated is perfectly smooth, although, in
  the case of the branchial sense-organs, the goblet-shaped masses of chitin, each of which contains
  a pore, are able to be pressed out beyond the level of the surface.</p>

  <p>As to their functions, we unfortunately do not know much that is definite. Patten considers
  that he has evidence of a gustatory function in the case of the mandibular organs, and suggests
  also a temperature-sense in the case of some of these organs. The large organ of the flabellum and
  the branchial organs he has not taken into consideration. The situation of these organs puts the
  suggestion of any gustatory function, as far as they are concerned, out of the question; and I do
  not think it probable that such large specialized organs would exist only for the estimation of
  temperature, when one sees how, in the higher animals, the temperature-nerves and the nerves of
  common sensation are universally distributed over the body. As already stated, the structure of
  the branchial organs seems to me to point to organs for estimating varying pressures more than
  anything else, and I am strongly inclined to look upon the whole set of organs as the derivatives
  of the lateral sense-organs of annelids, such as are described by Eisig in the Capitellid√¶. This
  is Patten's opinion with respect to the mandibular organs; and from what I have shown, these
  organs cannot be separated in type of structure from those of the flabellum and the branchial
  sense-organs.</p>

  <p>In our search, then, for the origin of the vertebrate auditory organ in Limulus and its allies,
  we see so far the following indications<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1.  The auditory organ of the vertebrate is regarded as a special organ belonging to a
  segmentally arranged set of lateral sense-organs, whose original function was co-ordination and
  equilibration.</p>

  <p>2.  Such a set of segmentally arranged lateral sense-organs is found in annelids in connection
  with the dorsal cirri of the ventral parapodia.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page368">{368}</span></div>

  <p>3.  If, as has been supposed, there is a genetic connection between (1) and (2) and if, as I
  suppose, the vertebrates did not arise from the annelids directly, but from a protostracan group,
  then it follows that the lateral sense-organs, one of which gave rise to the auditory organ, must
  have been situated on the protostracan appendages.</p>

  <p>4.  In Limulus, which is the sole surviving representative of the pal√¶ostracan group, such
  special sense-organs are found on both the prosomatic and mesosomatic appendages, and therefore
  may be expected to give a direct clue to the origin of the vertebrate auditory organ.</p>

  <p class="sp3">5.  Both from its position, its size, and its specialization, the flabellum,
  <i>i.e.</i> an organ corresponding to the flabellum, must be looked upon as more likely to give a
  direct clue to the origin of the auditory organ than the sense-organs of the branchial appendages,
  or the so-called gustatory organs of the mandibles.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Auditory Organs of Arachnids and Insects.</span></p>

  <p>The difficulty of the investigating these organs consists in the fact that so little is known
  about them in those Arthropoda which live in the water; the only instance of any organ apparently
  of the nature of an auditory organ, is the pair of so-called auditory sacs at the base of the
  antenn√¶ in various decapods. We are in a slightly better position when we turn to the land-living
  arthropods; here the presence of stridulating organs in so many instances carries with it the
  necessity of an organ for appreciating sound. It has now been shown that such stridulating organs
  are not confined to the Insecta, but are present also in the scorpion group, and I myself have
  added to their number by the discovery of a distinct stridulating apparatus in various members of
  the Phrynid√¶. We may then take it for granted that arachnids as well as insects hear. Where is the
  auditory organ?</p>

  <p>Many observers believe that certain surface-organs found universally among the spiders, to
  which Gaubert has given the name of lyriform organs, are auditory in function. His investigations
  show that they are universally present on the limbs and pro-meso-sternite of all spiders; that
  they are present singly, not in groups, on the limbs of Thelyphonus, and that a group of them
  exists on the second segment of each limb in the members of the Phrynus tribe. In the latter case
  this organ is the most elaborate of all described by him.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page369">{369}</span></div>

  <p>It is especially noticeable that they do not exist in Galeodes or in the scorpions, but in the
  former special sense-organs are found in the shape of the so-called 'racquet-organs,' on the basal
  segments of the most posterior pair of appendages, and also, according to Gaubert, on the
  extremity of the palps and the first pair of feet, while in the latter they occur in the shape of
  the pectens.</p>

  <p>This observation of Gaubert suggests that the place of the lyriform organs in other arachnids
  is taken in Galeodes by the racquet-organs, and in the scorpions by the pectens. Bertkau,
  Schimk√©witsch, and Wagner, as quoted by Gaubert, all suggest that the lyriform organs of the
  arachnids belong to the same group of sense-organs as the porous chordotonal organs of the
  Insecta, sense-organs which have been found in every group of Insecta, and are generally regarded
  as auditory organs. Gaubert does not agree with this, and considers the lyriform organs to be
  concerned with the temperature-sense rather than with audition.</p>

  <p>The chordotonal organs of insects have been specially studied by Graber. He divides them into
  two groups, the poriferous and the non-poriferous, the former being characterized by the presence
  of pores on the surface arranged in groups or lines. These poriferous chordotonal organs are
  remarkably constant in position, being found only at the base of the wings on the subcostal ridge,
  in marked contrast to the other group of chordotonal organs which are found chiefly on the
  appendages in various regions. The striking character of this fixity of position of these organs
  and the universality of their presence in the whole group, led Graber to the conclusion that in
  these poriferous chordotonal organs we are studying a form of auditory apparatus which
  characterized the ancestor of the insect-group. These organs are always well developed on the hind
  wings, and in the large group of Diptera the auditory apparatus has usurped the whole of the
  function of the wing; for the balancers or 'halteres,' as they are called, are the sole
  representatives of the hind wings, and they are usually considered to be of the nature of auditory
  organs. It is instructive to find that such an auditory organ serves not only for the purpose of
  audition, but also as an organ of equilibration; thus Lowne gives the evidence of various
  observers, and confirms it himself, that removal of the balancers destroys the power of orderly
  flight in the animal.</p>

  <p>A striking peculiarity of these organs in the Insecta, as described <span class="pagenum"
  id="page370">{370}</span>by Graber, is the bulging of the porous canal near its termination (Fig.
  <a href="#fig150">150</a>, C). This bulging is filled with a homogeneous, highly refractive
  material, from which, according to Lowne, a chordotonal thread passes, to be connected with a
  ganglion-cell and nerve. This sphere of refractive material he calls the 'capitellum' of the
  chordotonal thread. The presence of this material produces in a surface view an appearance as of a
  halo around the terminal plaque with its central pore; Graber has attempted to represent this by
  the white area round the central area (in Fig. <a href="#fig150">150</a>, B). A very similar
  appearance is presented by the surface view of the flabellum in those parts where the tube runs
  straight to the surface, so that the refractive material which fills the oval bulging shines
  through the overlying chitin and appears to surround the terminal plaque with a translucent
  halo.</p>

  <div class="ac w45 fcenter sp2">

  </div>

  <p>Such a peculiarity must have a very definite meaning, and suggests that the canals in the
  flabellum of Limulus and in the hind wings of insects belong to the same class of organ, the
  chitinous tubule with its nerve-terminal in the former corresponding to the chordotonal thread in
  the latter. One wonders whether this sphere of refractive material or 'capitellum' (to use Lowne's
  phraseology) is so universally present in order to act as a damper upon the vibrations of the
  chordotonal thread in the one case and of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page371">{371}</span>chitinous tubule in the other, just as the <i>membrana tectoria</i> and
  the otoliths act in the case of the vertebrate ear.</p>

  <p>Patten says that the only organs which seem to him to be comparable with the gustatory porous
  organs of Limulus are the sense-organs in the extremities of the palps and of the first pair of
  legs of Galeodes, as described by Gaubert. I imagine that he was thinking only of arachnids, for
  the comparison of his drawings with those of Graber show what a strong family resemblance exists
  between the poriferous sense-organs of Limulus and those of the insects. On the course of the
  terminal nerve-fibres, between the nerve-cell and their entrance into the porous chitinous canal,
  Graber describes the existence of rods or scolophores. On the course of the terminal fibres in the
  Limulus organ, between the nerve-cells and their entrance into the porous chitinous canal, Patten
  describes a spindle-shaped swelling, containing a number of rod-like thickenings among the fibrils
  in the spindle, which present an appearance reminiscent of the rods described by Graber.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It appears as though a type of sense-organ, characterized by the presence of pores
  on the surface and a fine chitinous canal which opens at these pores, was largely distributed
  among the Arthropoda. According to Graber, this kind of organ represents a primitive type of
  sense-organ, which was probably concerned with audition and equilibration, and he expresses
  surprise that similar organs have not been discovered among the Crustacea. It is, therefore, a
  matter of great interest to find that so ancient a type of animal as Limulus, closely allied to
  the primitive crustacean stock, <i>does</i> possess poriferous sense-organs upon its appendages
  which are directly comparable with these poriferous chordotonal organs of the Insecta.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Pectens of Scorpions.</span></p>

  <p>Among special sense-organs such as those with which I am now dealing, the pectens of scorpions
  and the 'racquet-organs' of Galeodes must, in all probability, be classed. I have given my reasons
  for this conclusion in my former paper.<a id="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> At present
  such reasons are based entirely upon the structure of the organs; experimental <span
  class="pagenum" id="page372">{372}</span>evidence as to their function is entirely wanting. With
  respect to the pectens of the scorpion (Fig. <a href="#fig151">151</a>), it has been suggested
  that they are of the nature of copulatory organs, a suggestion which may be dismissed without
  hesitation, for they are not constructed after the fashion of claspers, but are simply elaborate
  sense-organs, and, as such, are found equally in male or female. The only observer who has
  hitherto specially studied the structure of the sense-organs in the pecten is, as far as I know,
  Gaubert, and he describes their structure together with that of the sense-organs of the racquets
  of Galeodes, in connection with the lyriform organs of arachnids, as though he recognized a family
  resemblance between the three sets of organs.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The pecten of the scorpions is an elaborate sense-organ, or rather group of sense-organs, the
  special organ being developed on each tooth of the comb; its surface, which is frequently
  flattened, being directed backwards and inwards, when the axis of the pecten is horizontal at
  right angles to the length of the body. The surface view of this part of the tooth resembles that
  of the branchial organs or of the flabellum in Limulus, in that it is thickly covered with
  circular patches, in the centre of which an ill-defined appearance as of a fine pore is seen. In
  Fig. <a href="#fig152">152</a>, B, I give a sketch of the surface view of a part of the organ.</p>

  <p>Transverse sections of a tooth of the comb of <i>Scorpio Europ√¶us</i> present the appearance
  given in Fig. <a href="#fig152">152</a>, A, and show that each of these circular patches is the
  surface-view of a goblet-shaped chitinous organ, Fig. <a href="#fig152">152</a>, C, from the
  centre of which a short, somewhat cylindrical chitinous spike projects. Within this spike, and
  running through the goblet into the subjacent tissue, is a fine tubule. The series of goblets
  gives rise to the appearance of the circular plaques on the surface-view, while the spike with its
  tubule <span class="pagenum" id="page373">{373}</span>is the cause of the ill-defined appearance
  of the central pore, just as the terminal pore is much less conspicuous on surface-view in the
  spike-organs of the flabellum than in the purely poriferous organs, no part of which projects
  beyond the level of the chitinous surface.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The fine tubule is soon lost in the thickened but soft modification of the chitinous layer
  (<i>ch.</i>) which is characteristic of the sense-organ; at all events, I have not succeeded in
  tracing it through this layer with any more success than in the corresponding case of the tubules
  belonging to the smaller goblets of the branchial sense-organ of Limulus already described.</p>

  <p>At the base of the modified chitinous layer a series of cells is seen, many, if not all, of
  which belong to the chitinogenous layer. Next to these is the marked layer of ganglion-cells
  (<i>gl.</i>), similar to those seen in the flabellum of Limulus. The rest of the space in the
  section of the tooth is filled up with nerves (<i>n.</i>) and blood-spaces (<i>bl.</i>) just as in
  the section, Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a>, of the flabellum of Limulus.</p>

  <p>Gaubert does not appear to have seen the goblets at all clearly; <span class="pagenum"
  id="page374">{374}</span>he describes them simply as conical eminences, and states that they
  "recouvrent un pore analogue a celui des poils mais plus petit; il est rempli par le protoplasma
  de la couche hypodermique." From the ganglion, according to him, nervous prolongations pass, which
  traverse the chitinogenous layer and terminate at the base of the conical eminences. Each of these
  prolongations "pr√©sente sur son trajet, mais un peu plus pr√®s du ganglion que de sa terminaison
  p√©riph√©rique, une cellule nerveuse fusiforme (<i>g.</i>) offrant, comme celles du ganglion, un
  gros noyau." He illustrates his description with the following, Fig. <a href="#fig153">153</a>,
  taken from his paper.</p>

  <p>I have not been able to obtain any evidence of a fusiform nerve-cell on the course of the
  terminal nerve-fibres as depicted by him; fusiform cells there are in plenty, as depicted in my
  drawing, but none with a large nucleus resembling those of the main ganglion. In no case, either
  in the flabellum or in the branchial organs of Limulus, or in the pecten-organs, have I ever seen
  a ganglion-cell within the chitin-layer; all the nuclei seen there resemble those of the cells of
  the hypodermis or else the elongated nuclei characteristic of the presence of nerve-fibres.
  Gaubert's drawing is a striking one, and I have looked through my specimens to see whether there
  was anything similar, but have hitherto failed to obtain any definite evidence of anything of the
  kind.</p>

  <p>I feel, myself, that an exhaustive examination of the structure and function of the pecten of
  scorpions ought to be undertaken. At present I can only draw the attention of my readers to the
  similarity of the arrangement of parts, and of the nature of the end-organs, in the sense-organs
  of the flabellum of Limulus and of the pecten of the scorpion. In both cases the special
  nerve-fibres terminate in a massive ganglion, situated just below the chitinogenous layer. In both
  cases the terminal fibres from these ganglion-cells pass through the modified chitinous layer to
  supply end-organs of a striking character; and although the end-organ of the pecten of the
  scorpion does <span class="pagenum" id="page375">{375}</span>not closely resemble the majority of
  the end-organs of the flabellum, yet it does resemble, on the one hand, the isolated poriferous
  spikes found on the flabellum (Fig. <a href="#fig149">149</a>) and, on the other, the poriferous
  goblets found on the sense-patches of the branchial appendages of Limulus (Fig. <a
  href="#fig144">144</a>, A), so that a combination of these two end-organs would give an appearance
  very closely resembling that of the pecten of the scorpion.</p>

  <p>Finally, the special so-called 'racquet-organs' of Galeodes, which are found on the most basal
  segments of the last pair of prosomatic appendages, ought also to be considered here. Gaubert has
  described their structure, and shown how the nerve-trunk in the handle of the racquet splits up
  into a great number of separate bundles, which spread out fan-shaped to the free edge of the
  racquet; each of these separate bundles supplies a special sense-organ, which terminates as a
  conical eminence on the floor of a deep groove, running round the whole free edge of the racquet.
  This groove is almost converted into a canal, owing to the projection of its two sides. Gaubert
  imagines that the sense-organs are pushed forward out of the groove to the exterior by the
  turgescence of the whole organ; each of the nerve-fibres forming a bundle is, according to
  Gaubert, connected with a nerve-cell before it reaches its termination.</p>

  <p>This sketch of the special sense-organs on the appendages of Limulus, of the scorpions, of
  Galeodes, and other arachnids, and their comparison with the porous chordotonal organs of insects,
  affords reason for the belief that we are dealing here with a common group of organs, which,
  although their nature is not definitely known, have largely been accredited with the functions of
  equilibration and audition, a group of organs among which the origin of the auditory organ of
  vertebrates must be sought for, upon any theory of the origin of vertebrates from arthropods.</p>

  <p>Whenever in any animal these organs are concentrated together to form a special organ, it is
  invariably found that the nerve going to this organ is very large, out of all proportion to the
  size of the organ, and also that the nerve possesses, close to its termination in the organ, large
  masses of nerve-cells. Thus, although the whole hind wing in the blow-fly has been reduced to the
  insignificant balancers or 'halteres,' yet, as Lowne states, the nerves to them are the largest in
  the body.</p>

  <p>The pectinal nerve in the scorpion is remarkable for its size, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page376">{376}</span>so, also, is the nerve to the flabellum in Limulus, while the large size
  of the auditory nerve in the vertebrate, in distinction to the size of the auditory apparatus, has
  always aroused the attention of anatomists.</p>

  <p>Throughout this book my attention has been especially directed to both Limulus and the scorpion
  group in endeavouring to picture to myself the ancestor of the earliest vertebrates, because the
  Eurypterid√¶ possessed such marked scorpion-like characteristics; so that in considering the origin
  of a special sense-organ, such as the vertebrate auditory organ near the junction of the prosoma
  and mesosoma, it seems to me that the presence of such marked special sense-organs as the
  flabellum on the one hand and the pecten on the other, must both be taken into account, even
  although the former is an adjunct to a prosomatic appendage, while the latter represents,
  according to present ideas, the whole of a mesosomatic appendage.</p>

  <p>From the point of view that the VIIIth nerve represents a segment immediately posterior to that
  of the VIIth, it is evident that an organ in the situation of the pecten, immediately posterior to
  the operculum, <i>i.e.</i> according to my view, posterior to the segment originally represented
  by the VIIth nerve, is more correctly situated than an organ like the flabellum, which belongs to
  a segment anterior to the operculum.</p>

  <p class="sp3">On the other hand, from the point of view of the relationship between the scorpions
  and the king-crabs, it is a possibly debatable question whether the pecten really belongs to a
  segment posterior to the operculum. The position of any nerve in a series depends upon its
  position of origin in the central nervous system, rather than upon the position of its peripheral
  organ. Now, Patten gives two figures of the brain of the scorpion built up from serial sections.
  In both he shows that the main portion of the pectinal nerve arises from a swelling, to which he
  gives the name <i>ganglion nodosum</i>. This swelling arises on each side in close connection with
  the origin of the most posterior prosomatic appendage-nerve, according to his drawings, and
  posteriorly to such origin he figures a small nerve which he says supplies the distal parts of the
  sexual organs. This nerve is the only nerve which can be called the opercular nerve, and
  apparently arises posteriorly to the main part of the pectinal nerve. If this is so, it would
  indicate that the pectens arose from sense-organs which were originally, like the flabella,
  pre-opercular in position, but have shifted to a post-opercular position.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page377">{377}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Origin of the Parachordals and Auditory Cartilaginous
  Capsule.</span></p>

  <p>In addition to what I have already said, there is another reason why a special sense-organ such
  as the pecten is suggestive of the origin of the vertebrate auditory organ, in that such a
  suggestion gives a clue to the possible origin of the parachordals and auditory cartilaginous
  capsules.</p>

  <p>In the lower vertebrates the auditory organ is characterized by being surrounded with a
  cartilaginous capsule which springs from a special part of the axial cartilaginous skeleton on
  each side, known as the pair of parachordals. The latter, in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, form a pair of
  cartilaginous bars, which unite the trabecular bars with the branchial cartilaginous basket-work.
  They are recognized throughout the Vertebrata as distinct from the trabecular bars, thus forming a
  separate paired cartilaginous element between the trabecul√¶ and the branchial cartilaginous
  system, which of itself indicates a position for the auditory capsule between the prosomatic
  trabecul√¶ and the mesosomatic branchial cartilaginous system.</p>

  <p>The auditory capsule and parachordals when formed are made of the same kind of cartilage as the
  trabecul√¶, <i>i.e.</i> of hard cartilage, and are therefore formed from a gelatin-containing
  tissue, and not from muco-cartilage. Judging from the origin already ascribed to the trabecul√¶,
  viz. their formation from the great prosomatic entochondrite or plastron, this would indicate that
  a second entochondrite existed in the ancestor of the vertebrate in the region of the junction of
  the prosoma and mesosoma, which was especially connected with the sense-organ to which the
  auditory organ owes its origin. This pair of entochondrites becoming cartilaginous would give
  origin to the parachordals, and subsequently to the auditory capsules, their position being such
  that the nerve to the operculum would be surrounded at its origin by the growth of cartilage.</p>

  <p>On this line of argument it is very significant to find that the scorpions do possess a second
  pair of entochondrites, viz. the supra-pectinal entochondrites, situated between the nerve-cord
  and the pectens, so that if the ancestor of the Cephalaspid was sufficiently scorpion-like to have
  possessed a second pair of entochondrites and at the same time a pair of special sense-organs of
  the nature either of <span class="pagenum" id="page378">{378}</span>the pectens or flabella, then
  the origin of the auditory apparatus would present no difficulty.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is also easy to see that the formation of the parachordals from entochondrites
  homologous with the supra-pectinal entochondrites, would give a reason why the VIIth or opercular
  nerve is involved with the VIIIth in the formation of the auditory capsule, especially if the
  special sense-organ which gave origin to the auditory organ was originally a pre-opercular
  sense-organ such as the flabellum, which subsequently took up a post-opercular position like that
  of the pecten.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Evidence of Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</span></p>

  <p>As to the auditory apparatus itself, we see that the elaborate organ for hearing&mdash;the
  cochlea&mdash;has been evolved in the vertebrate phylum itself. In the lowest vertebrates the
  auditory apparatus tends more and more to resolve itself into a simple epithelial sac, the walls
  of which in places bear auditory hairs projecting into the sac, and in part form otoliths. Such a
  simple sac forms the early stage of the auditory vesicle in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, according to
  Shipley; subsequently, by a series of foldings and growings together, the chambers of the ear of
  the adult Petromyzon, as figured and described by Retzius, are formed. Further, we see that
  throughout the Vertebrata this sac was originally open to the exterior, the auditory vesicle being
  first an open pit, which forms a vesicle by the approximating of its sides, the last part to close
  being known as the <i>recessus labyrinthicus</i>; in many cases, as in elasmobranchs, this part
  remains open, or communicates with the exterior by means of the <i>ductus endolymphaticus</i>.</p>

  <p>Judging, therefore, from the embryological evidence, it would appear that the auditory organ
  originated as a special sense-organ, formed by modified epithelial cells of the surface, which
  epithelial surface becoming invaginated, came to line a closed auditory vesicle under the surface.
  This special sense-organ was innervated from a large ganglionic mass of nerve-cells, situated
  close against the peripheral sense-cells, the axis-cylinder processes of which formed the sensory
  roots of the nerve.</p>

  <p>Yet another peculiarity of striking significance is seen in connection with the auditory organ
  of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. The opening of the cartilaginous capsule towards the brain is a large one
  (Fig. <a href="#fig154">154</a>), and <span class="pagenum" id="page379">{379}</span>admits the
  passage not only of the auditory and facial nerves, but also of a portion of the peculiar tissue
  which surrounds the brain. The large cells of this tissue, with their feebly staining nuclei and
  the pigment between them, make them quite unmistakable; and, as I have already stated, nowhere
  else in the whole of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is such a tissue found. When I first noticed these cells
  within the auditory capsule, it seemed to me almost impossible that my interpretation of them as
  the remnant of the generative and hepatic tissue which surrounds the brain of animals such as
  Limulus could be true, for it seemed too unlikely that a part of the generative system could ever
  have become included in the auditory capsule. Still, they are undoubtedly there; and, as already
  argued with respect to the substance round the brain, they must represent some pre-existing tissue
  which was functional in the ancestor of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. If my interpretation is right, this
  tissue must be generative and hepatic tissue, and its presence in the auditory capsule immediately
  becomes a most important piece of evidence, for it proves that the auditory organ must have been
  originally so situated that a portion of the generative and hepatic mass surrounding the cephalic
  region of the nervous system followed the auditory nerve to the peripheral sense-organ.</p>

  <p>Here there was a test of the truth of my theory ranking second only to the test of the median
  eyes; the strongest possible evidence of the truth of any theory is given when by its aid new and
  unexpected facts are brought to light. The theory said that in the group of animals from which the
  vertebrates arose, a special sense-organ of the nature of an auditory organ must have existed on
  the base of one of the appendages situated at the junction of the prosoma and mesosoma, and that
  into this basal part of the appendage a portion of the cephalic mass of generative and hepatic
  material must have made its way in close contiguity to the nerve of the special organ.</p>

  <p>The only living example which nearly approaches the ancient extinct forms from which, according
  to the theory, the vertebrates arose, is Limulus, and, as has already been shown, in this animal,
  in the very position postulated by the theory, a large special sense-organ&mdash;the
  flabellum&mdash;exists, which, as already stated, may well have given rise to a sense-organ
  concerned with equilibration and audition. If, further, it be found that a diverticulum of the
  generative and hepatic material does accompany the nerve of the flabellum in the basal part of the
  appendage, then the evidence becomes very strong that the auditory organ of Ammoc&#x0153;tes,
  <i>i.e.</i> of the ancient Cephalaspids, was derived from an organ homologous with the flabellum;
  that, therefore, the material round the brain of Ammoc&#x0153;tes was originally generative and
  hepatic material; that, in fact, the whole theory is true, for all the parts of it hang together
  so closely that, if one portion is accepted, all the rest must follow. As pointed out in my
  address at Liverpool, and at the meeting of the Philosophical Society at Cambridge, it is a most
  striking fact that a mass of the generative and hepatic tissue does accompany the flabellar nerve
  into the basal part of this appendage. Into no other appendage of Limulus is there the slightest
  sign of any intrusion of the generative and hepatic masses; nowhere, except in the auditory
  capsule, is there any sign of the peculiar large-celled tissue which surrounds the brain and upper
  part of the spinal cord of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. The actual position of the flabellum on the basal
  part of the ectognath is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig155">155</a>, A, and in Fig. <a
  href="#fig155">155</a>, B, I have removed the chitin, to show the generative and hepatic tissue
  (<i>gen.</i>) lying beneath.</p>

  <p>The reason why, to all appearance, the generative and hepatic mass penetrates into the basal
  part of this appendage only is apparent <span class="pagenum" id="page381">{381}</span>when we see
  (as Patten and Redenbaugh have pointed out) to what part of the appendage the flabellum in reality
  belongs.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Patten and Redenbaugh, in their description of the prosomatic appendages of Limulus, describe
  the segments of the limbs as (1) the dactylopodite, (2) the propodite, (3) the mero- and
  carpo-podites, (4) the ischiopodite, (5) the basipodite, and (6) the coxopodite (<i>cox.</i> in
  Fig. <a href="#fig155">155</a>). Still more basal than the coxopodite is situated the entocoxite
  (<i>ent.</i> in Fig. <a href="#fig155">155</a>), which is composed of three sclerites <span
  class="pagenum" id="page382">{382}</span>or sensory knobs, to use Patten's description. The middle
  one of these three sclerites enlarges greatly in the digging appendage, and grows over the
  coxopodite to form the base from which the flabellum springs. Thus, as they have pointed out, the
  flabellum does not belong to the coxopodite of the appendage, but to the middle sensory knob of
  the entocoxite. Upon opening the prosomatic carapace, it is seen that the cephalic generative and
  hepatic masses press closely against the internal surface of the prosomatic carapace and also of
  the entocoxite, so that any enlargement of one of the sensory knobs of the entocoxite would
  necessarily be filled with a protrusion of the generative and hepatic masses. This is the reason
  why the generative and hepatic material apparently passes into the basal segment of the ectognath,
  and not into that of the endognaths; it does not really pass into the coxopodite of the appendage,
  but into an enlarged portion of the entocoxite, which can hardly be considered as truly belonging
  to the appendage. Kishinouye has stated that a knob arises in the embryo at the base of each of
  the prosomatic locomotor appendages, but that this knob develops only in the last or digging
  appendage (ectognath) forming the flabellum. Doubtless the median sclerites of the entocoxites of
  the endognaths represent Kishinouye's undeveloped knobs.</p>

  <p>I conclude, therefore, that the flabellum, together with its basal part, is an adjunct to the
  appendage rather than a part of it, and might, therefore, easily remain as a separate and
  well-developed entity, even although the appendage itself dwindled down to a mere tentacle.</p>

  <p>The evidence appears to me very strong that the flabellum of Limulus and the pecten of
  scorpions are the most likely organs to give a clue to the origin of the auditory apparatus of
  vertebrates. At present both the Eurypterids and Cephalaspids have left us in the lurch; in the
  former there is no sign of either flabellum or pecten; in the latter, no sign of any auditory
  capsule beyond Rohon's discovery of two small apertures situated dorsally on each side of the
  middle line in Tremataspis, which he considers to be the termination of the <i>ductus
  endolymphaticus</i> on each side. In both cases it is probable, one might almost say certain, that
  any such special sense-organ, if present, was not situated externally, but was sunk below the
  surface as in Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The method by which such a sense-organ, situated externally on <span
  class="pagenum" id="page383">{383}</span>the surface of the animal, comes phylogenetically to form
  the lining wall of an internally situated membranous capsule is given by the ontogeny of this
  capsule, which shows step by step how the sense-organ sinks in and forms a capsule, and finally is
  entirely removed from the surface except as regards the <i>ductus endolymphaticus</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>The special apparatus for hearing is of a very different character from that for vision or
    for smell, for its nerve belongs to the infra-infundibular group of nerves, and not to the
    supra-infundibular, as do those of the other two special senses. Of the five special senses the
    nerves for touch, taste, and hearing, all belong to the infra-infundibular segmental
    nerve-groups. The invertebrate origin, then, of the vertebrate auditory nerve must be sought for
    in the infra-&#x0153;sophageal segmental group of nerves, and not in the
    supra-&#x0153;sophageal.</p>
    <p>The organs supplied by the auditory nerve are only partly for the purpose of hearing; there
    is always present also an apparatus&mdash;the semicircular canals&mdash;concerned with
    equilibration and co-ordination of movements. Such equilibration organs are not confined to the
    auditory nerve, but in the water-living vertebrates are arranged segmentally along the body,
    forming the organs of the lateral line in fishes; the auditory organ is but one of these lateral
    line organs, which has been specially developed.</p>
    <p>These lateral line organs have been compared to similar segmental organs found in connection
    with the appendages in worms, especially the respiratory appendages. In accordance with this
    suggestion we see that they are all innervated from the region of the respiratory
    nerves&mdash;the vagus, glosso-pharyngeal, and facial&mdash;nerves which originally supplied the
    respiratory appendages of the pal√¶ostracan ancestor.</p>
    <p>The logical conclusion is that the appendages of the Pal√¶ostraca possessed special
    sense-organs concerned with the perception of special vibrations, especially in the mesosomatic
    or respiratory region, and that somewhere at the junction of the prosoma and mesosoma, one of
    these sense-organs was specially developed to form the origin of the vertebrate auditory
    apparatus.</p>
    <p>Impressed by this reasoning I made search for some specially striking sense-organ at the base
    of one of the appendages of Limulus, at the junction of the prosoma and mesosoma, and was
    immediately rewarded by the discovery of the extraordinary nature of the flabellum, which
    revealed itself as an elaborate sense-organ supplied with a nerve out of all proportion to its
    size. Up to this time no one had the slightest conception that this flabellum was a special
    sense-organ; the discovery of its nature was entirely due to the logical following out of the
    theory of the origin of vertebrates described in this book.</p>
    <p>The structure of this large sense-organ is comparable with that of the sense-organs of the
    pectens of the scorpion, and of many other organs found on the appendages of various members of
    the scorpion group, of arachnids and <span class="pagenum" id="page384">{384}</span>other
    air-breathing arthropods. Many of these organs, such as the lyriform organs of arachnids, and
    the 'halteres' or balancers of the Diptera, are usually regarded as auditory and equilibration
    organs.</p>
    <p>On all the mesosomatic appendages of Limulus very remarkable sense-organs are found,
    apparently for estimating pressures, which, when the appendages sank into the body to form with
    their basal parts the branchial diaphragms of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, could easily be conceived as
    remaining at the surface, and so giving rise to the lateral line organs.</p>
    <p>Further confirmation of the view that an organ, such as the flabellum, must be looked upon as
    the originator of the vertebrate auditory organ, is afforded by the extraordinary coincidence
    that in Limulus a diverticulum of the generative and hepatic mass accompanies the flabellar
    nerve into the basal part of the digging appendage, while in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, accompanying the
    auditory nerve into the auditory capsule, there is seen a mass of cells belonging to that
    peculiar tissue which fills up the space between the brain and the cranial walls, and has
    already, on other grounds, been homologized with the generative and hepatic masses which fill up
    the encephalic region of Limulus.</p>
    <p class="sp0">For all these reasons special sense-organs, such as are found in the flabellum of
    Limulus and in the pectens of scorpions, may be looked upon as giving origin to the vertebrate
    auditory apparatus. In such case it is highly probable that the parachordals, with the auditory
    capsules attached, arose from a second entochondrite of the same nature as the plastron; a
    probability which is increased by the fact that the scorpion does possess a second
    entochondrite, which, owing to its special relations to the pecten, is known as the
    supra-pectinal entochondrite.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The consideration of the auditory nerve and the auditory apparatus terminates the comparison
  between the cranial nerves of the vertebrate and the prosomatic and mesosomatic nerves of the
  arthropod, and leaves us now free to pass on to the consideration of the vertebrate spinal nerves
  and the organs they supply. Before doing so, it is advisable to pass in review the conclusions
  already attained.</p>

  <p>Starting with the working hypothesis that the central nervous system of the vertebrate has
  arisen from the central nervous system of the arthropod, but has involved and enclosed the
  alimentary canal of the latter in the process, so that there has been no reversal of surfaces in
  the derivation of the one form from the other, we have been enabled to compare closely all the
  organs of the head-region in the two groups of animals, and in no single case have we been
  compelled to make any startling or improbable assumptions. The simple following out of this clue
  has led in every case in the most natural <span class="pagenum" id="page386">{386}</span>manner to
  the interpretation of all the organs in the head-region of the vertebrate from the corresponding
  organs of the arthropod.</p>

  <p>That it is possible to bring together all the striking resemblances between organs in the two
  classes of animals, such as I have done in preceding chapters, has been ascribed to a perverted
  ingenuity on my part&mdash;a suggestion which is flattering to my imaginative powers, but has no
  foundation of fact. There has been absolutely no ingenuity on my part; all I have done is to
  compare organs and their nerve-supply, as they actually exist in the two groups of animals, on the
  supposition that there has been no turning over on to the back, no reversal of dorsal and ventral
  surfaces. The comparison is there for all to read; it is all so simple, so self-evident that,
  given the one clue, the only ingenuity required is on the part of those who fail to see it.</p>

  <p>The great distinction that has arisen between the two head-regions is the disappearance of
  appendages as such, never, however, of important organs on those appendages. If the olfactory
  organs of the one group were originally situated on antennules, the olfactory organs still remain,
  although the antennules as such have disappeared. The coxal excretory organs at the base of the
  endognaths remain and become the pituitary body. A special sense-organ, such as the flabellum of
  Limulus or the pecten of scorpion, remains and gives rise to the auditory organ. A special
  glandular organ, the uterus in the base of the operculum, remains, and gives rise to the thyroid
  gland. The branchi√¶ and sense-organs on the mesosomatic appendages remain, and even the very
  muscles to a large extent. As will be seen later, the excretory organs at the base of the
  metasomatic appendages remain. It is merely the appendage as such which vanishes either by
  dwindling away, or by so great an alteration as no longer to be recognizable as an appendage.</p>

  <p>This dwindling process was already in full swing before the vertebrate stage; it is only a
  continuation of a previous tendency, as is seen in the dwindling of the prosomatic appendages in
  the Merostomata and the inclusion of the branchi√¶ within the body of the scorpion. Already among
  the Pal√¶ostraca, swimming had largely taken the place of crawling. The whole gradual
  transformation from the arthropod to the vertebrate is associated with a transformation from a
  crawling to a swimming animal&mdash;with the concomitant loss of locomotor appendages as such, and
  the alteration of the shape of <span class="pagenum" id="page387">{387}</span>the animal into the
  lithe fish-like form. The consideration of the manner in which this latter change was brought
  about, takes us out of the cranial into the spinal region.</p>

  <p>If we take Limulus as the only living type of the Pal√¶ostraca, we are struck with the fact that
  the animal consists to all intents and purposes of prosomatic and mesosomatic regions only; the
  metasoma consisting of the segments posterior to the mesosoma is very insignificant, so that the
  large mass of the animal consists of what has become the head-region in the vertebrate; the spinal
  region, which has become in the higher vertebrates by far the largest region of the body, can
  hardly be said to exist in such an animal as Limulus. As to the Eurypterids and others, similar
  remarks may be made, though not to the same extent, for in them a distinct metasoma does
  exist.</p>

  <p>In this book I have considered up to the present the cranial region as a system of segments,
  and shown how such segments are comparable, one by one, with the corresponding segments in the
  prosoma and mesosoma of the presumed arthropod ancestor.</p>

  <p>In the spinal region such direct comparison is not possible, as is evident on the face of it;
  for even among vertebrates themselves the spinal segments are not comparable one by one, so great
  is the variation, so unsettled is the number of segments in this region. This meristic variation,
  as Bateson calls it, is the great distinctive character of the spinal region, which distinguishes
  it from the cranial region with its fixed number of nerves, and its substantive rather than
  meristic variation. At the borderland, between the two regions, we see how the one type merges
  into the other; how difficult it is to fix the segmental position of the spino-occipital nerves;
  how much more variable in number are the segments supplied by the vagus nerves than those anterior
  to them.</p>

  <p>This meristic variation is a sign of instability, of want of fixedness in the type, and is
  evidence, as already pointed out, that the spinal region is newer than the cranial. This
  instability in the number of spinal segments does not necessarily imply a variability in the
  number of segments of the metasoma of the invertebrate ancestor; it may simply be an expression of
  adaptability in the vertebrate phylum itself, according to the requirements necessitated by the
  conversion of a crawling into a swimming animal, and the subsequent conversion of the swimming
  into a terrestrial or flying animal.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page388">{388}</span></div>

  <p>However many may have been the original number of segments belonging to the spinal region, one
  thing is certain&mdash;the segmental character of this region is remarkably clearly shown, not
  only by the presence of the segmental spinal nerves, but also by the marked segmentation of the
  mesoblastic structures. The question, therefore, that requires elucidation above all others is the
  origin of the spinal mesoblastic segments, <i>i.e.</i> of the c&#x0153;lomic cavities of the
  trunk-region, and the structures derived from their walls.</p>

  <p>Proceeding on the same lines as in the case of the cranial segments, it is necessary in the
  first instance to inquire of the vertebrate itself as to the scope of the problem in this region.
  In addition to the variability in the number of segments so characteristic of the spinal region,
  the complete absence in each spinal segment of a lateral root affords another marked difference
  between the two regions. Here, except, of course, at the junction of the spinal and cranial
  regions, each segmental nerve arises from two roots only, dorsal and ventral, and these roots are
  separately sensory and motor, and not mixed in function as was the lateral root of each cranial
  segment. Now, these lateral roots were originally the nerves supplying the prosomatic and
  mesosomatic appendages with motor as well as sensory fibres. The absence, therefore, of lateral
  roots in the spinal region implies that in the vertebrate none of the musculature belonging to the
  metasomatic appendages has remained. Consequently, as far as muscles are concerned, the clue to
  the origin of the spinal segments must be sought for in the segmentation of the body-muscles.</p>

  <p>Here, in contradistinction to the cranial region, the segmentation is most marked, for the
  somatic spinal musculature of all vertebrates can be traced back to a simple sheet of longitudinal
  ventral and dorsal muscles, such as are seen in all fishes. This sheet is split into segments or
  myotomes by transverse connective tissue septa or myo-commata; each myotome corresponding to one
  spinal segment.</p>

  <p>In addition to the evidence of segmentation afforded by the body-musculature in all the higher
  vertebrates, similar evidence is given by the segmental arrangement of parts of the supporting
  tissue to form vertebr√¶. Such segments have received the name of sclerotomes, and each sclerotome
  corresponds to one spinal segment.</p>

  <p>Yet another marked peculiarity of this region is the segmental arrangement of the excretory
  organs. Just as our body-musculature <span class="pagenum" id="page389">{389}</span>has arisen
  from the uniformly segmented simple longitudinal musculature of the lowest fish, so, as we pass
  down the vertebrate phylum, we find more and more of a uniform segmental arrangement in the
  excretory organs.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The origin of all these three separate segmentations may, in accordance with the
  phraseology of the day, be included in the one term&mdash;the origin of the spinal mesoblastic
  segments&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of the c&#x0153;lomic cavities of the trunk-region and the structures
  derived from their walls.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Origin of the Segmental Excretory Organs.</span></p>

  <p>Of these three clues to the past history of the spinal region, the segmentation manifested by
  the presence of vertebr√¶ is the least important, for in Ammoc&#x0153;tes there is no sign of
  vertebr√¶, and their indications only appear at transformation. Especially interesting is the
  segmentation due to the excretory organs, for the evidence distinctly shows that such excretory
  organs have steadily shifted more and more posteriorly during the evolution of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>In Limulus the excretory organs are in the prosomatic region&mdash;the coxal glands; these
  become in the vertebrate the pituitary body.</p>

  <p>In Amphioxus the excretory organs are in the mesosomatic region, segmentally arranged with the
  gills.</p>

  <p>In vertebrates the excretory organs are in the metasomatic region posterior to the gills, and
  are segmentally arranged in this region. Their investigation has demonstrated the existence of
  three distinct stages in these organs: 1. A series of segmental excretory organs in segments
  immediately following the branchial segments. This is the oldest of the three sets, and to these
  organs the name of the <i>pronephros</i> is given. 2. A second series which extends more
  posteriorly than the first, overlaps them to an extent which is not yet settled, and takes their
  place; to them is given the name of the <i>mesonephros</i>. 3. A third series continuous with the
  mesonephric is situated in segments still more posterior, supplants the mesonephros and forms the
  kidneys of all the higher vertebrates. This forms the <i>metanephros</i>.</p>

  <p>These three sets of excretory organs are not exactly alike in their origin, in that the
  pronephric tubules are formed from a different portion of the c&#x0153;lomic walls to that from
  which the meso- and <span class="pagenum" id="page390">{390}</span>metanephric tubules are formed,
  and the former alone gives origin to a duct, which forms the basis for the generative and urinary
  ducts, and is called the <i>segmental duct</i>. The mesonephric tubules, called also the Wolffian
  body, open into this duct.</p>

  <p>In order to make the embryology of these excretory organs quite clear, I will make use of van
  Wijhe's phraseology and also of his illustrations. He terms the whole c&#x0153;lomic cavity the
  <i>proc&#x0153;lom</i>, which is divisible into a ventral unsegmented part, the body-cavity or
  <i>metac&#x0153;lom</i>, and a dorsal segmented part, the <i>somite</i>. This latter part again is
  divided into a dorsal part&mdash;the <i>epimere</i>&mdash;and a part connecting the dorsal part
  with the body-cavity, to which therefore he gives the name of <i>mesomere</i>.</p>

  <p>The cavity of the epimere disappears, and its walls form the muscle and cutis plates of the
  body. The part which forms the muscles is known as the <i>myotome</i>, which separates off from
  the mesomere, leaving the latter as a blind sac&mdash;the
  <i>mesoc&#x0153;lom</i>&mdash;communicating by a narrow passage with the body cavity or
  <i>metac&#x0153;lom</i>. At the same time, from the mesomere is formed the <i>sclerotome</i>,
  which gives rise to the skeletal tissues of the vertebr√¶, etc., so that van Wijhe's epimere and
  mesomere together correspond to the original term, protovertebra, or somite of Balfour; and when
  the myotome and sclerotome have separated off, there is still left the intermediate cell-mass of
  Balfour and Sedgwick, <i>i.e.</i> the sac-like mesoc&#x0153;le of van Wijhe, the walls of which
  give origin to the mesonephrotome or <i>mesonephros</i>. Further, according to van Wijhe, the
  dorsal part of the unsegmented metac&#x0153;lom is itself segmented, but not, as in the case of
  the mesoc&#x0153;le, with respect to both splanchnopleuric and somatopleuric walls. The
  segmentation is manifest only on the somatopleuric side, and consists of a distinct series of
  hollow somatopleuric outgrowths, called by him <i>hypomeres</i>, which give rise to the
  <i>pronephros</i> and the segmental duct.</p>

  <p>Van Wijhe considers that the whole metac&#x0153;lom was originally segmented, because in the
  lower vertebrates the segmentation reaches further ventral-wards, so that in Selachia the
  body-cavity is almost truly segmental. Also in the gill-region of Amphioxus the cavities which are
  homologous with the body-cavity arise segmentally.</p>

  <p>As is well known, Balfour and Semper were led, from their embryological researches, to compare
  the nephric organs of vertebrates with those of annelids, and, indeed, the nature of the
  vertebrate segmental excretory organs has always been the fact which has kept alive the belief in
  the origin of vertebrates from a segmented annelid. These segmental organs thus compared were the
  mesonephric tubules, and doubts arose, especially in the mind of Gegenbaur, as to the validity of
  such a comparison, because the mesonephric tubules did not open to the exterior, but into a
  duct&mdash;the segmental duct&mdash;which was an unsegmented structure opening into the cloaca;
  also because the segmental duct, which was the excretory duct of the pronephros, was formed first,
  and the mesonephric tubules only opened into it after it was fully formed. Further, the pronephros
  was said to arise from an outbulging of the somatopleuric mesoblast, which extended over a limited
  number of metameres, and was not segmental, but continuous. Gegenbaur and others therefore argued
  that the original prevertebrate excretory organ was the pronephros and its duct, not the
  mesonephros, from which they concluded that the vertebrate must have been derived from an
  unsegmented type of animal, and not from the segmented annelid type.</p>

  <p>Such a view, however, has no further reason for acceptance, as it was based on wrong premises,
  for R√ºckert has shown that the pronephros does arise as a series of segmental nephric tubules, and
  is not unsegmented. He also has pointed out that in Torpedo the anterior part of the pronephric
  duct shows indications of being segmented, a statement fully borne out by the researches of Maas
  on Myxine, who gives the clearest evidence that in this animal the anterior part of the pronephric
  duct is formed by the fusion of a series of separate ducts, each of which in all probability once
  opened out separately to the exterior.</p>

  <p>R√ºckert therefore concludes that Balfour and Semper were right in deriving the segmental organs
  of vertebrates from those of annelids, but that the annelid organs are represented in the
  vertebrate, not by the mesonephric tubules, but by the pronephric tubules and their ducts, which
  originally opened separately to the exterior. By the fusion of such tubules the anterior part of
  the segmental duct was formed, while its posterior part either arose by a later c&#x0153;nogenetic
  lengthening, or is the only remnant of a series of pronephric tubules which originally extended
  the whole length of the body, as suggested also by Maas and Boveri. R√ºckert therefore supposed
  that the mesonephric tubules were a secondary set of nephric organs, which were not necessarily
  directly derived from the annelid nephric organs.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page393">{393}</span></div>

  <p>At present, then, R√ºckert's view is the one most generally accepted&mdash;the original annelid
  nephric organs are represented by the pronephric tubules and the pronephric duct, not by the
  mesonephric tubules, which are a later formation. This latter statement would hold good if the
  mesonephric tubules were found entirely in segments posterior to those containing the pronephric
  tubules; such, however, is said not to be the case, for the two sets of organs are said to overlap
  in some cases; even when they exist in the same segments, the former are said always to be formed
  from a more dorsal part of the c&#x0153;lom than the pronephros, always to be a later formation,
  and never to give any indication of communicating with the exterior except by way of the
  pronephric duct.</p>

  <p>The recent observations of Brauer on the excretory organs of the Gymnophiona throw great doubt
  on the existence of mesonephric and pronephric tubules in the same segment. He criticizes the
  observations on which such statements are based, and concludes that, as in Hypogeophis, the
  nephrotome which is cut off after the separation of the sclero-myotome gives origin to the
  pronephros in the more anterior regions, just as it gives origin to the mesonephros in the more
  posterior regions. In fact, the observations of van Wijhe and others do not in reality show that
  two excretory organs may be formed in one segment, the one mesonephric from the remains of the
  mesomere and the other pronephric from the hypomere, but rather that in such cases there is only
  one organ&mdash;the pronephros&mdash;part of which is formed from the mesomere and part from the
  hypomere. Brauer goes further than this, and doubts the validity of any distinction between
  pronephros and mesonephros, on the ground of the former arising from a more ventral part of the
  proc&#x0153;lom than the latter; for, as he says, it is only possible to speak of one part of the
  somite as being more ventral than another part when both parts are in the same segment; so that if
  pronephric and mesonephric organs are never in the same segment, we cannot say with certainty that
  the former arises more ventrally than the latter.</p>

  <p>These observations of Brauer strongly confirm Sedgwick's original statement that the pronephric
  and mesonephric organs are homodynamous organs, in that they are both derived from the original
  serially situated nephric organs, the differences between them being of a subordinate nature and
  not sufficient to force us to believe that the mesonephros is an organ of quite different origin
  to the <span class="pagenum" id="page394">{394}</span>pronephros. So, also, Price, from his
  investigations of the excretory organs of Bdellostoma, considers that in this animal both
  pronephros and mesonephros are derived from a common embryonic kidney, to which he gives the name
  <i>holonephros</i>.</p>

  <p>Brauer also is among those who conclude that the vertebrate excretory organs were derived from
  those of annelids; he thinks that the original ancestor possessed a series of similar organs over
  the whole pronephric and mesonephric regions, and that the anterior pronephric organs, which alone
  form the segmental duct, became modified for a larval existence&mdash;that their peculiarities
  were adaptive rather than ancestral. This last view seems to me very far-fetched, without any
  sufficient basis for its acceptance. According to the much more probable and reasonable view, the
  pronephros represents the oldest and original excretory organs, while the mesonephros is a later
  formation. Brauer's evidence seems to me to signify that the pronephros, mesonephros, and
  metanephros are all serially homologous, and that the pronephros bears much the same relation to
  the mesonephros that the mesonephros does to the metanephros. The great distinction of the
  pronephros is that it, and it alone, forms the segmental duct.</p>

  <p>We may sum up the conclusions at which we have now arrived as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1.  The pronephric tubules and the pronephric duct are the oldest part of the excretory system,
  and are distinctly in evidence for a few segments only in the most anterior part of the
  trunk-region immediately following the branchial region. They differ also from the mesonephric
  tubules by not being so clearly segmental with the myotomes.</p>

  <p>2.  The mesonephric tubules belong to segments posterior to those of the pronephros, are
  strictly segmental with the myotomes, and open into the pronephric duct.</p>

  <p>3.  All observers are agreed that the two sets of excretory organs resemble each other in very
  many respects, as though they arose from the same series of primitive organs, and, according to
  Sedgwick and Brauer, no distinction of any importance does exist between the two sets of organs.
  Other observers, however, consider that the pronephric organs, in part at all events, arise from a
  part of the nephroc&#x0153;le more ventral than that which gives origin to the mesonephric organs,
  and that this difference in position of origin, combined <span class="pagenum"
  id="page395">{395}</span>with the formation of the segmental duct, does constitute a true
  morphological distinction between the two sets of organs.</p>

  <p>4. All the recent observers are in agreement that the vertebrate excretory organs strongly
  indicate a derivation from the segmental organs of annelids.</p>

  <p>The very strongest support has been given to this last conclusion by the recent discoveries of
  Boveri and Goodrich upon the excretory organs of Amphioxus. According to Boveri, the nephric
  tubules of Amphioxus open into the dorsal c&#x0153;lom by one or more funnels. Around each funnel
  are situated groups of peculiar cells, called by him 'Fadenzellen,' each of which sends a long
  process across the opening of the funnel. Goodrich has examined these 'Fadenzellen,' and found
  that they are typical pipe-cells, or solenocytes, such as he has described in the nephridial
  organs of various members of the annelid group Polych√¶ta. Also, just as in the Polych√¶ta, the
  ciliated nephric tubule has no internal funnel-shaped opening into the c&#x0153;lom, but
  terminates in these groups of solenocytes. "Each solenocyte consists of a cell-body and nucleus
  situated at the distal free extremity of a delicate tube; the proximal end of the tube pierces the
  wall of the nephridial canal and opens into its lumen. A single long flagellum arising from the
  cells works in the tube and projects into the canal."</p>

  <p>The exceedingly close resemblance between the organs of Amphioxus and those of Phyllodoce, as
  given in his paper, is most striking, and, as he says, leads to the conclusion that the excretory
  organs of Amphioxus are essentially identical with the nephridia of certain polych√¶te worms.</p>

  <p>It is to me most interesting to find that the very group of annelids, the Polych√¶ta, which
  possess solenocytes so remarkably resembling those of the excretory organs of Amphioxus, are the
  highest and most developed of all the Annelida. I have argued throughout that the law of evolution
  consists in the origination of successive forms from the dominant group then alive, dominance
  signifying the highest type of brain-power achieved up to that time. The highest type among
  Annelida is found in the Ch√¶topoda; from them, therefore, the original arthropod type must have
  sprung. This original group of Arthropoda gave rise to the two groups of Crustacea and Arachnida,
  in my opinion also to the Vertebrata, and, as already mentioned, it is convenient to give it a
  generalized <span class="pagenum" id="page396">{396}</span>name, the Protostraca, from which
  subsequently the Pal√¶ostraca arose.</p>

  <p>The similarity between the excretory organs of Amphioxus and those of Phyllodoce suggests that
  the protostracan ancestor of the vertebrates arose from the highest group of the
  Ch√¶topoda&mdash;the Polych√¶ta. The evidence which I have already given points, however, strongly
  to the conclusion that the vertebrate did not arise from members of the Protostraca near to the
  polych√¶te stock, but rather from members in which the arthropod characters had already become well
  developed&mdash;members, therefore, which were nearer the Trilobita than the Polych√¶ta. Such early
  arthropods would very probably have retained in part excretory organs of the same character as
  those found in the original polych√¶te stock, and thus account for the presence of solenocytes in
  the excretory organs of Amphioxus.</p>

  <p>In connection with such a possibility, I should like to draw attention to the observations of
  Claus and Spangenberg on the excretory organs of Branchipus&mdash;that primitive phyllopod, which
  is recognized as the nearest approach to the trilobites at present living. According to Claus, an
  excretory apparatus exists in the neighbourhood of each nerve-ganglion, and Spangenberg finds a
  perfectly similar organ in the basal segment of each appendage&mdash;a system, therefore, of
  excretory organs as segmentally arranged as those of Peripatus. Claus considers that although
  these organs formed an excretory system, it is not possible to compare them with the annelid
  segmental organs, because he thought the cells in question arose from ectoderm. Now, the striking
  point in the description of the excretory cells in these organs, as described both by Claus and
  Spangenberg, is that they closely resemble the pipe-cells or solenocytes of Goodrich; each cell
  possesses a long tube-like projection, which opens on the surface. They appear distinctly to
  belong to the category of flame-cells, and resemble solenocytes more than anything else. According
  to Goodrich, the solenocyte is probably an ectodermal cell, so that even if it prove to be the
  case, as Claus thought, that these pipe-cells of Branchipus are ectodermal, they would still claim
  to be derived from the segmental organs of annelids, especially of the Polych√¶ta, being, to use
  Goodrich's nomenclature, true nephridial organs, as opposed to c&#x0153;lomostomes.</p>

  <p>These observations of Claus and Spangenberg suggest not only that the primitive arthropod of
  the trilobite type possessed segmental <span class="pagenum" id="page397">{397}</span>organs in
  every segment directly derived from those of a polych√¶te ancestor, but also that such organs were
  partly somatic and partly appendicular in position. Such a suggestion is in strict accord with the
  observations of Sedgwick on the excretory organs of the most primitive arthropod known, viz.
  Peripatus, where also the excretory organs, which are true segmental organs, are partly somatic
  and partly appendicular. Further, the excretory organs of the Scorpion and Limulus group are again
  partly somatic and partly appendicular, receiving the name of coxal glands, because there is a
  ventral projection of the gland into the coxa of the corresponding appendage.</p>

  <p>Judging from all the evidence available, it is probable that when the arthropod stock arose
  from the annelids, simultaneously with the formation of appendages, the segmental somatic nephric
  organs of the latter extended ventrally into the appendage, and thus formed a segmental set of
  excretory organs, which were partly somatic, partly appendicular in position, and might therefore
  be called coxal glands.</p>

  <p>As already stated, all investigators of the origin of the vertebrate excretory organs are
  unanimous in considering them to be derived from segmental organs of the annelid type. I naturally
  agree with them, but, in accordance with my theory, would substitute the words "primitive
  arthropod" for the word "annelid," for all the evidence I have accumulated in the preceding
  chapters points directly to that conclusion. Further, the most primitive of the three sets of
  vertebrate segmental organs&mdash;the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros&mdash;is
  undoubtedly the pronephros; consequently the pronephric tubules are those which I consider to be
  more directly derived from the coxal glands of the primitive arthropod ancestor. Such a derivation
  appears to me to afford an explanation of the difficulties connected with the origin of the
  pronephros and mesonephros respectively, which is more satisfactory than that given by the direct
  derivation from the annelid.</p>

  <p>The only living animal which we know of as at all approaching the most primitive arthropod type
  is, as pointed out by Korschelt and Heider, Peripatus; and Peripatus, as is well known, possesses
  a true c&#x0153;lom and true c&#x0153;lomic excretory organs in all the segments of the body.
  Sedgwick shows that at first a true c&#x0153;lom, as typical as that of the annelids, is formed in
  each segment of the body, and that then this c&#x0153;lom (which represents in the vertebrate van
  Wijhe's pro-c&#x0153;lom) <span class="pagenum" id="page398">{398}</span>splits into a dorsal and
  a ventral part. In the anterior segments of the body the dorsal part disappears (presumably its
  walls give origin to the mesoblast from which the dorsal body-muscles arise), while the ventral
  part remains and forms a nephroc&#x0153;le, giving origin to the excretory organs of the adult.
  According to von Kennel, the cavity becomes divided into three spaces, which for a time are in
  communication&mdash;a lateral (I.), a median (II.), and a dorso-median (III.). The dorso-median
  portion becomes partitioned off, and this, as well as the greater part of the lateral portion,
  which lies principally in the foot, is used up in providing elements for the formation of the
  body- and appendage-muscles respectively and the connective tissue.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig157">157</a> I reproduce von Kennel's diagram of a section across a
  Peripatus embryo, in which I. represents the lateral appendicular part of the c&#x0153;lom, II.
  the ventral somatic part, and III. the dorsal part which separates off from the ventral and
  lateral parts, and, as its walls give origin largely to the body-muscles, may be called the
  myoc&#x0153;le. The muscles of the appendages are formed from the ventral part of the original
  proc&#x0153;lom, just as I have argued is the case with the muscles of the splanchnic segmentation
  in vertebrates.</p>

  <p>Sedgwick states that the ventral part of the c&#x0153;lom extends into the base of each
  appendage, and there forms the end-sac of each nephric tubule, into which the nephric funnel
  opens, thus forming a coxal gland; this end-sac or vesicle in the appendage is called by him the
  internal vesicle (<i>i.v.</i>), because later another vesicle is formed from the ventral
  c&#x0153;lom in the body itself, close against the nerve-cord on each side, which he calls the
  external vesicle (<i>e.v.</i>). (<i>Cf.</i> Fig. <a href="#fig158">158</a>, taken from Sedgwick.)
  This second vesicle is, according to him, formed later in the development from the nephric tubule
  of the internal vesicle, so that it discharges its contents to the exterior by the same opening as
  the original tubule. Of course, as he points out, the whole system of internal and external
  vesicles and nephric tubules are all simply derivatives of the original ventral part of the
  c&#x0153;lom or nephroc&#x0153;le.</p>

      (coxal gland).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here, then, in Peripatus, and presumably, therefore, in members of the Protostraca, we see that
  the original segmental organs of the annelid have become a series of nephric organs, which
  extended into the base of the appendages, and may therefore be called coxal glands; also it is
  clear, from Sedgwick's description, that if the appendages disappeared, the nephric organs would
  still remain, not as coxal glands, but as purely somatic excretory glands. They would still be
  homologous with the annelid segmental organs, or with the coxal glands, but would arise <i>in
  toto</i> from a part of the ventral c&#x0153;lom or nephroc&#x0153;le, more dorsal than the former
  appendicular part, because the appendages and their enclosed c&#x0153;lom are always situated
  ventrally to the body. Again, according to Sedgwick, the nephric tubules are connected with two
  c&#x0153;lomic vesicles, the one in the appendage the internal vesicle, and the other, the
  so-called bladder, or the external vesicle, in the body itself, close against the nerve-cord.
  Sedgwick appears to consider that either of these vesicles may form the end-sac of a nephric
  tubule, for he discusses the question whether the single vesicle, which in each case gives origin
  to the nephridia of the first three legs, corresponds to the internal or external vesicle. He
  <span class="pagenum" id="page400">{400}</span>decides, it is true, in favour of the internal
  vesicle, and therefore considers the excretory organ to be appendicular, <i>i.e.</i> a coxal
  gland, in these segments as well as in those more posterior. Still, the very discussion shows that
  in his opinion, at all events, the external vesicle might represent the end-sac of the tubule, in
  the absence of the internal or appendicular vesicle.</p>

  <p>Such an arrangement as Sedgwick describes in Peripatus is the very condition required to give
  rise to the pronephric and mesonephric tubules, as deduced by me from the consideration of the
  vertebrate, and harmonizes and clears up the controversy about the mesonephros and pronephros in
  the most satisfactory manner. Both pronephros and mesonephros are seen to be derivatives of the
  original annelid segmental organs, not directly from an annelid, but by way of an arthropodan
  ancestor; the difference between the two is simply that the pronephric organs were coxal glands,
  and indicate, therefore, the presence of the original metasomatic appendages, while the
  mesonephric organs were homologous organs, formed in segments of later origin which had lost their
  appendages. For this reason the pronephros is said to be formed, in part at least, from a portion
  of the c&#x0153;lom situated more ventrally than the purely somatic part which gives rise to the
  mesonephros. For this reason Sedgwick, Brauer, etc., can say that the mesonephros is strictly
  homodynamous with the pronephros; while equally R√ºckert, Semon, and van Wijhe can say it is not
  homodynamous, in so far that the two organs are not derived strictly from absolutely homologous
  parts of the c&#x0153;lom. For this reason Semon can speak of the mesonephros as a dorsal
  derivative of the pronephros, just as Sedgwick says that the external or somatic vesicle of
  Peripatus is a derivative of the appendicular nephric organ. For this reason the pronephros, or
  rather a part of it, is always derived from the somatopleuric layer, for, as is clear from Miss
  Sheldon's drawing, the part of the c&#x0153;lom in Peripatus which dips into the appendage is
  derived from the somatopleuric layer alone.</p>

  <p>Such a c&#x0153;lom as that of Peripatus, Fig. <a href="#fig157">157</a>, would represent the
  origin of the vertebrate c&#x0153;lom, and would therefore represent the proc&#x0153;lom of van
  Wijhe. In strict accordance with this, we see that it separates into a dorsal part, the walls of
  which give origin to the somatic muscles, or at all events to the great longitudinal dorsal
  muscles of the animal, and a ventral part, which forms a nephroc&#x0153;le, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page401">{401}</span>dips into the appendage, and gives origin to the muscles of the
  appendage. In the vertebrate, after the somatic dorsal part or myoc&#x0153;le has separated off, a
  ventral part is left, which forms a nephroc&#x0153;le in the trunk-region, and gives origin to the
  splanchnic striated muscles in the cranial region, <i>i.e.</i> to the muscles which, according to
  my theory, were once appendicular muscles. This ventral nephroc&#x0153;lic part is divisible in
  the trunk into a segmented part, which forms the excretory organs proper, and an unsegmented part,
  the metac&#x0153;le or true body-cavity of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>This comparison of the proc&#x0153;lom of the vertebrate and arthropod signifies that the
  vertebrate metac&#x0153;le was directly derived by ventral downgrowth from the arthropod
  nephroc&#x0153;le, so that if, as I suppose, the vertebrate nervous system represents the
  conjoined nervous system and alimentary canal of the arthropod, then the vertebrate
  metac&#x0153;le, or body-cavity, must have been originally confined to the region on each side of
  the central nervous system, and from this position have spread ventrally, to enclose ultimately
  the new-formed vertebrate gut. This means that the body-cavity (metac&#x0153;le) of the vertebrate
  is not the same as the body-cavity of the annelid, but corresponds to a ventral extension of the
  nephroc&#x0153;le, or ventral part of such body-cavity.</p>

  <p>Such a phylogenetic history is most probable, because it explains most naturally and simply the
  facts of the development of the vertebrate body-cavity; for the mesoblast always originates in the
  neighbourhood of the notochord and central nervous system, and the lumen of the body-cavity always
  appears first in that region, and then extends laterally and ventrally on each side until it
  reaches the most ventral surface of the embryo, thus forming a ventral mesentery, which ultimately
  disappears, and the body-cavity surrounds the gut, except for the dorsal mesentery. Thus Shipley,
  in his description of the formation of the mesoblastic plates which line the body-cavity in
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, describes them as commencing in two bands of mesoblast situated on each side,
  close against the commencing nervous system<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"These two bands are separated dorsally by the juxtaposition of the dorsal wall of the
  mesenteron and the epiblast, and ventrally by the hypoblastic yolk-cells which are in contact with
  the epiblast over two-thirds of the embryo. Subsequently, but at a much later date, the mesoblast
  is completed ventrally by the downgrowth on <span class="pagenum" id="page402">{402}</span>each
  side of these mesoblastic plates. The subsequent downward growth is brought about by the cells
  proliferating along the free ventral edge of the mesoblast, these cells then growing ventralwards,
  pushing their way between the yoke-cells and epiblast."</p>

  <p>The derivation of the vertebrate pronephric segmental organs from the metasomatic coxal glands
  of a primitive arthropod would mean, if the segmental organs of Peripatus be taken as the type,
  that such glands opened to the exterior on every segment, either at the base of the appendage or
  on the appendage itself. It is taken for granted by most observers that the pronephric segmental
  organs once opened to the exterior on each segment, and then, from some cause or other, ceased to
  do so, and the separate ducts, by a process of fusion, came to form a single segmental duct, which
  opened into the cloaca. Many observers have been led to the conclusion that the pronephric duct is
  epiblastic in origin, although from its position in the adult, it appears far removed from all
  epiblastic formations. However, at no time in the developmental history is there any clear
  evidence of actual fusion of any part of the pronephric organ with the epidermis, and the latest
  observer, Brauer, is strongly of opinion that there is never sufficiently close contact with the
  epidermis to warrant the statement that the epiblastic cells take part in the formation of the
  duct. All that can be said is, that the formation of the duct takes place at a time when the
  pronephric diverticulum is in close propinquity to the epidermis, before the ventral downgrowth of
  the myotome has taken place.</p>

  <p>The formation of the anterior portion of the pronephric duct is, according to Maas in Myxine,
  and Wheeler in Petromyzon, undoubtedly brought about by the fusion of a number of pronephric
  tubules, which, according to Maas, are clearly seen in the youngest specimens as separate
  segmental tubes; each of these tubules is supplied by a capillary network from a segmental branch
  of the aorta, as in the tubules of Amphioxus according to Boveri, and does not possess a
  glomerulus.</p>

  <p>The posterior part of the duct into which the mesonephric tubules enter possesses also a
  capillary network, which Maas considers to represent the original capillary network of a series of
  pronephric tubules, the only remnant of which is the duct into which the mesonephric tubules open.
  He therefore argues that the pronephric duct indicates a series of pronephric tubules, which
  originally extended <span class="pagenum" id="page403">{403}</span>along the whole length of the
  body, and were supplanted by the mesonephric tubules, which also belonged to the same
  segments.</p>

  <p>I also think that the paired appendages which have left the pronephric tubules as signs of
  their past existence, existed originally, in the invertebrate stage, on every segment of the body.
  But I do not consider that such a statement is at all equivalent to saying that such pairs of
  tubules must have existed upon every one of the segments existing at the present day; for it seems
  to me that R√ºckert is much more likely to be right when he says that in Selachians the duct
  clearly does grow back, and is not formed throughout <i>in situ</i>; so that he gives a double
  explanation of the formation of the duct&mdash;a palingenetic anterior part formed by the fusion
  of the extremities of the original excretory tubules, to which a posterior c&#x0153;nogenetic
  lengthening has been added.</p>

  <p>It does not seem to me at all necessary that the immediate invertebrate ancestor of the
  vertebrate should have possessed excretory organs which opened out separately to the exterior on
  each segment; a fusion may already have taken place in the invertebrate stage, and so a single
  duct have been acquired for a number of organs. Such a suggestion has been made by R√ºckert,
  because of the fact discovered by Cunningham and E. Meyer, that the segmental organs of <i>Lanice
  conchilega</i> are on each side connected together by a single strong longitudinal canal. I would,
  however, go further than this and say, that even although the nephric organs of the polych√¶te
  ancestor opened out on every segment, and although the primitive arthropodan ancestor derived from
  such polych√¶te possessed coxal glands which opened out either on to or at the base of each
  appendage, similarly to those of Peripatus, yet the immediate arthropodan ancestor, with its
  pal√¶ostracan affinities, may already have possessed metasomatic coxal glands, all of which opened
  into a single duct, with a single opening to the exterior.</p>

  <p>Judging from Limulus, such was very probably the case, for Patten and Hazen have shown (1) that
  the coxal glands of Limulus are segmental organs belonging to the prosomatic segments; (2) that
  the organs belonging to the cheliceral and ectognathal segments are not developed; (3) that the
  four glands belonging to the endognaths become connected together by a <i>stolon</i>, which
  communicates with a single nephric duct, opening to the exterior on the basal segment of the 5th
  prosomatic appendage (the last endognath). At <span class="pagenum" id="page404">{404}</span>no
  time is there any evidence of any separate openings or any fusion with the ectoderm, such as might
  indicate separate openings of these prosomatic coxal segmental organs. Thus we see that in
  Limulus, which is presumably much nearer the annelid condition than the vertebrate, all evidence
  of separate nephric ducts opening to the exterior on each prosomatic segment has entirely
  disappeared, just as is the case in the metasomatic coxal glands (<i>i.e.</i> the pronephros) of
  the vertebrate. What is seen in the prosomatic region of Limulus, and doubtless also of the
  Eurypterids, may very probably have occurred in the metasomatic region of the immediate
  invertebrate ancestors of the vertebrate, and so account for the single pronephric duct belonging
  to a number of pronephric organs.</p>

  <p>The interpretation of these various embryological investigations may be summed up as
  follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1.  The ancestor of the vertebrates possessed a pair of appendages on each segment; into the
  base of each of these appendages the segmental excretory organ sent a diverticulum, thus forming a
  coxal gland.</p>

  <p>2.  Such coxal glands, even in the invertebrate stage, may have discharged into a common duct
  which opened to the exterior most posteriorly.</p>

  <p>3.  Then, from some cause, the appendages were rendered useless, and dwindled away, leaving
  only the pronephric organs to indicate their former presence. At the end of this stage the animal
  possessed vertebrate characteristics.</p>

  <p>4.  For the purpose of increasing mobility, of forming an efficient swimming instead of a
  crawling animal, the body-segments increased in number, always, as is invariably the case, by the
  formation of new ones between those already formed and the cloacal region, and so of necessity
  caused an elongation of the pronephric duct. Into this there now opened the ducts of the segmental
  organs formed by recapitulation, those, therefore, belonging to the
  body-segments&mdash;mesonephric&mdash;having nothing to do with appendages, for the latter had
  already ceased to exist functionally, and would not, therefore, be repeated with each meristic
  repetition.</p>

  <p>This, so to speak, passive lengthening of the pronephric duct in consequence of the lengthening
  of the early vertebrate body by the addition of metameres, each of which contained only
  mesonephric and no pronephric tubules, is, to my mind, an example of a principle <span
  class="pagenum" id="page405">{405}</span>which has played an important part in the formation of
  the vertebrate, viz. that the meristic variation by which the spinal region of even the lowest of
  existing vertebrates has been formed, has largely taken place in the vertebrate phylum itself, and
  that such changes must be eliminated before we can picture to ourselves the pre-vertebrate
  condition. As an example, I may mention the remarkable repetition of similar segments pictured by
  Bashford Dean in Bdellostoma. Such repetition leads to passive lengthening of such parts as are
  already formed but are not meristically repeated: such are the notochord, the vertebrate
  intestine, the canal of the spinal cord, and possibly the lateral line nerve. The fuller
  discussion of this point means the discussion of the formation of the vertebrate alimentary canal;
  I will therefore leave it until I come to that part of my subject, and only say here that the
  evidence seems to me to point to the conclusion that at the time when the vertebrate was formed,
  the respiratory and cloacal regions were very close together, the whole of the metasoma being
  represented by the region of the pronephros alone.</p>

  <p>Here, as always, the evidence of Ammoc&#x0153;tes tends to give definiteness to our
  conceptions, for Wheeler points out that up to a length of 7 mm. the pronephros only is formed;
  there is no sign of the more posteriorly formed mesonephros. Now we know, as pointed out in
  Chapter VI., p. <a href="#page228">228</a>, this is the time of Kupffer's larval stage of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes. This is the period during which the invertebrate stage is indicated in the
  ontogeny, so that, in accordance with all that has gone before, this means that the metasoma of
  the invertebrate ancestor was confined to the region of the pronephros.</p>

  <p>Again, take Shipley's account of the development of Petromyzon. He says&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The alimentary canal behind the branchial region may be divided into three sections.
  Langerhans has termed these the stomach, midgut, and hindgut, but as the most anterior of these is
  the narrowest part of the whole intestine, it would, perhaps, be better to call it
  &#x0153;sophagus. This part of the alimentary canal lies entirely in front of the yolk, and is,
  with the anterior region, which subsequently bears the gills, raised from the rest of the egg when
  the head is folded off. It is supported by a dorsal mesentery, on each side of which lies the
  head-kidney (pronephros)."</p>

  <p>Further on he says&mdash;</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page406">{406}</span></div>

  <p>"The hindgut is smaller than the midgut; its anterior limit is marked by the termination of the
  spiral valve, which does not extend into this region. The two segmental ducts open into it just
  where it turns ventrally to open to the exterior by a median ventral anus. Its lumen is from an
  early stage lined with cells which have lost their yolk, and it is in wide communication with the
  exterior from the first. This condition seems to be, as Scott suggests, connected with the
  openings of the ducts of the pronephros, for this gland is completed and seems capable of
  functioning long before any food could find its way through the midgut, or, indeed, before the
  stomod√¶um has opened."</p>

  <p class="sp3">Is there no significance in this statement of Shipley? Even if it be possible to
  find some special reason why the branchial and cloacal parts of the gut are freed from yolk and
  lined with serviceable epithelium a long time before the midgut, why should a bit of the midgut,
  which Shipley calls the &#x0153;sophagus, which is connected with the region of the pronephros and
  not of the branchi√¶, differ so markedly from the rest of the midgut? Surely the reason is that the
  branchial region of the gut, the pronephric region of the gut, and the cloacal region of the gut,
  belong to a different and earlier phase in the phylogenetic history of the Ammoc&#x0153;tes than
  does the midgut between the pronephric and cloacal regions. This observation of Shipley fits in
  with and emphasizes the view that the original animal from which the vertebrate arose consisted of
  a cephalic and branchial region, followed by a pronephric and cloacal region; the whole
  intermediate part of the gut, which forms the midgut, with its large lumen and spiral valve, and
  belongs to the mesonephric region, being a later formation brought about by the necessity of
  increasing the length of the body.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Origin of the Somatic Trunk-Musculature and the Formation of an
  Atrial Cavity.</span></p>

  <p>Next comes the question, why was the pronephros not repeated in the meristic repetition that
  took place during the early vertebrate stage? What, in fact, caused the disappearance of the
  metasomatic appendages, and the formation of the smooth body-surface of the fish?</p>

  <p>The embryological evidence given by van Wijhe and others of the manner in which the original
  superficially situated pronephros is <span class="pagenum" id="page407">{407}</span>removed from
  the surface and caused to assume the deeper position, as seen in the later embryo, is perfectly
  clear and uniform in all the vertebrate groups. The diagrams at the end of van Wijhe's paper,
  which I reproduce here, illustrate the process which takes place. At first the myotome (Fig. <a
  href="#fig159">159</a>, A) is confined to the dorsal region on each side of the spinal cord and
  notochord. Then (Fig. <a href="#fig159">159</a>, B) it separates from the rest of the somite and
  commences to extend ventrally, thus covering over the pronephros and its duct, until finally (Fig.
  <a href="#fig159">159</a>, C) it reaches the mid-ventral line on each side, and the foundations of
  the great somatic body-muscles are finally laid.</p>

  <p>In order, therefore, to understand how the obliteration of the appendages took place, we must
  first find out what is the past history of the myotomes. Why are they confined at first to the
  dorsal region of the body, and extend afterwards to the ventral region, forcing by their growth an
  organ that was originally external in situation to become internal?</p>

  <p>In the original discussion at Cambridge, I was accused of violating the important principle
  that in phylogeny we must look at the most elementary of the animals whose ancestors we seek, and
  was told that the lowest vertebrate was Amphioxus, not Ammoc&#x0153;tes; that therefore any
  argument as to the origin of vertebrates must proceed from the consideration of the former and not
  the latter animal. My reply was then, and is still, that I was considering the cranial region in
  the first place, and that therefore it was necessary to take the lowest vertebrate which possessed
  cranial nerves and sense-organs of a distinctly vertebrate character, a criterion evidently not
  possessed by Amphioxus. Such argument does not apply to the spinal region, so that, now that I
  have left the cranial region and am considering the spinal, I entirely agree with my critics that
  Amphioxus is likely to afford valuable help, and ought to be taken into consideration as well as
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes. The distinction between the value of the spinal (including respiratory) and
  cranial regions of Amphioxus for drawing phylogenetic conclusions is recognized by Boveri, who
  says that, in his opinion, "Amphioxus shows simplicity and undifferentiation rather than
  degeneration. If truly Amphioxus is somewhat degenerated, then it is so in its prehensile and
  masticatory apparatus, its sense organs, and perhaps its locomotor organs, owing to its method of
  living."</p>

  <p>Hatschek describes in Amphioxus how the c&#x0153;lom splits into a dorsal segmented portion,
  the protovertebra, and a ventral unsegmented portion, the lateral plates. He describes in the
  dorsal part the formation of myotome and sclerotome, as in the Craniota. Also, he describes how
  the myotome is at first confined to the dorsal region in the neighbourhood of the spinal cord and
  notochord, and subsequently extends ventrally, until, just as in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, the body is
  enveloped in a sheet of somatic segmented muscles, the well-known myomeres.</p>

  <p>The conclusion to be drawn from this is inevitable. Any explanation of the origin of the
  somatic muscles in Ammoc&#x0153;tes must also be an explanation of the somatic muscles in
  Amphioxus, and conversely; so that if in this respect Amphioxus is the more primitive and simpler,
  then the condition in Ammoc&#x0153;tes must be looked upon as derived from a more primitive
  condition, similar to that found in Amphioxus. Now, it is well <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'know'">known</span> that a most important distinction exists between
  Amphioxus and Ammoc&#x0153;tes in the topographical relation of the ventral portion of this
  muscle-sheet, for in the former it is separated from the gut and the body-cavity by the atrial
  space, while in the latter there is no such space. F√ºrbringer therefore concludes, as I have
  already mentioned, that this space has become obliterated in the Craniota, but that it must be
  taken into consideration in any attempt at formulating the nature of the ancestors of the
  vertebrate.</p>

  <p>Kowalewsky described this atrial space as formed by the ventral downgrowth of pleural folds on
  each side of the body, which met in the mid-ventral line and enclosed the branchial portion of the
  gut. According to this explanation, the whole ventral portion of the somatic musculature of the
  adult Amphioxus belongs to the extension of the pleural folds, the original body-musculature being
  confined to the dorsal region. This is expressed roughly on the external surface of Amphioxus by
  the direction of the connective tissue septa between the myotomes (<i>cf.</i> Fig. <a
  href="#fig162">162</a>, B). These septa, as is well known, bend at an angle, the apex of which
  points towards the head. The part dorsal to the bend represents the part of the muscle belonging
  to the original body; the part ventral to the bend is the pleural part, and represents the
  extension into the pleural folds.</p>

  <p>Lankester and Willey have attempted to give another explanation of the formation of the atrial
  cavity; they look upon it as originating from a ventral groove, which becomes a canal by the
  meeting of two <span class="pagenum" id="page410">{410}</span>outgrowths from the metapleure on
  each side. This canal then extends dorsalwards on each side, and so forms the atrial cavity; the
  metapleure still remains in the adult; the somatic muscles in the epipleure of the adult are the
  original body-muscles, and not extensions into an epipleuric fold, for there is no such fold.</p>

  <p>This explanation is a possible conception for the post-branchial portion of the atrium, but is
  impossible for the branchial region; for, as Macbride points out, as must necessarily be the case,
  the point of origin of the atrial wall is, in all stages of development, situated at the end of
  the gill-slit. It shifts in position with the position of the gill-slit, but there can be no
  backwards extension of the cavity. Macbride therefore agrees with Kowalewsky that the atrial
  cavity is formed by the simultaneous ventral extension of pleural folds, and of the branchial part
  of the original pharynx. Thus, in his summing up, he states: "In the larva practically the whole
  sides and dorsal portion of the pharynx represent merely the hyper-pharyngeal groove and the
  adjacent epithelium of the pharynx of the adult, the whole of the branchial epithelium of the
  adult being represented by a very narrow strip of the ventral wall of the pharynx of the larva.
  The subsequent disproportionate growth of this part of the pharynx of the larva, and of the
  adjacent portion of the atrial cavity, has given the impression that the atrial cavity grew
  upwards and displaced other structures, which is not the case."</p>

  <p>Further, van Wijhe states that the atrium extends beyond the atriopore right up to the anus,
  just as must have been the case if the pleural folds originally existed along the whole length of
  the body. His words are: "Allerdings hat sich das Atrium beim <i>Amphioxus lanceolatus</i>
  eigenth√ºmlich ausgebildet, indem sich dasselbe durch den ganzen Rumpf bis an den Anus, d.h. bis an
  die Wurzel des Schwanzes ausdehnt."</p>

  <p>We get, therefore, this conception of the origin of the somatic musculature of the vertebrate.
  The invertebrate ancestor possessed on each side, along the whole length of its body, a lateral
  fold or pleuron which was segmented with the body, and capable of movement with the body, because
  the dorsal longitudinal somatic muscles extended segmentally into each segment of the pleuron. By
  the ventral extension of these pleural folds, not only was the smooth body-surface of the
  vertebrate attained, but also the original appendages obliterated as such, leaving only as signs
  of their existence the <span class="pagenum" id="page411">{411}</span>branchi√¶, the pronephric
  tubules, and the sense-organs of the lateral line system.</p>

  <p>Such an explanation signifies that the somatic trunk-musculature of the vertebrate was derived
  from the dorsal longitudinal musculature of the body of the arthropod, and not from the ventral
  longitudinal musculature, and that therefore in the primitive arthropod stage the equivalent of
  the myotome of the vertebrate did not give origin to the ventral longitudinal muscles of the
  invertebrate ancestor. Now, as I have said, von Kennel states that in the proc&#x0153;lom of
  Peripatus a dorsal part (III. in Fig. <a href="#fig157">157</a>) is cut off which gives origin to
  the dorsal body-musculature, while the ventral part which remains (I. and II. in Fig. <a
  href="#fig157">157</a>) gives origin in its appendicular portion (I.) to the muscles of the
  appendage, and presumably in its ventral somatic portion (II.) to the ventral longitudinal muscles
  of the body. This dorsal cut-off part might be called the myotome, in the same sense as the
  corresponding part of the proc&#x0153;lom in the vertebrate is called the myotome. In both cases
  the muscles derived from it form only a part of the voluntary musculature of the animal, and in
  both cases the muscles in question are the dorsal longitudinal muscles of the body, to which must
  be added the dorso-ventral body-muscles. Now, the whole of my theory of the origin of vertebrates
  arose from the investigation of the structure of the cranial nerves, which led to the conception
  that their grouping is not, like the spinal, a dual grouping of motor and sensory elements, but a
  dual grouping to supply two sets of segments, characterized especially by the different
  embryological origin of their musculature. The one set I called the somatic segmentation, because
  the muscles belonging to it were the great longitudinal body-muscles; the other I called the
  splanchnic segmentation, because its muscles were those connected with the branchial and visceral
  arches. According to my theory, this latter segmentation was due to the segmentation of the
  appendages in the invertebrate ancestor; and in previous chapters, dealing as they do with the
  cranial region, attention was especially directed to the way in which the position of the striated
  splanchnic musculature could be explained by a transformation of the prosomatic and mesosomatic
  appendages. Now, I am dealing with the metasomatic region, in which it is true the appendages take
  a very subordinate place, but still something corresponding to the splanchnic segments of the
  cranial region might fairly be expected to exist, and I therefore <span class="pagenum"
  id="page412">{412}</span>desire to emphasize what appears to me to be the fact, that the
  musculature, which in the region of the trunk would correspond to that derived from the ventral
  segmentation of the mesoblast in the region of the head, may have arisen not only from the
  musculature of the appendages, but also from the ventral longitudinal musculature of the body of
  the invertebrate ancestor, for it seems probable that this latter musculature had nothing to do
  with the origin of the great longitudinal muscles of the vertebrate body, either dorsal or
  ventral.</p>

  <p>The way in which I imagine the obliteration of the atrial cavity to have taken place is
  indicated in Fig. <a href="#fig160">160</a>, B, which is a modification of a section across a
  trilobite-like animal as represented in Fig. <a href="#fig160">160</a>, A. As is seen, the pleural
  folds on each side have nearly met the bulged-out ventral body-surface. A continuation of the same
  process would give Fig. <a href="#fig160">160</a>, C, which is, to all intents and purposes, the
  same as Fig. <a href="#fig159">159</a>, C, taken from van Wijhe, and shows how the segmental duct
  is left in the remains of the atrial cavity. The lining walls of the atrial cavity are represented
  very black, in order to indicate the presence of pigment, as indeed is seen in the corresponding
  position in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. In these diagrams I have represented the median ventral surface as a
  large bulged-out bag, without indicating any structures in it except the ventral extension of the
  proc&#x0153;lom to form the metac&#x0153;lom. At present I will leave the space between the
  central nervous system and the ventral mesentery blank, as in the diagrams; in my next chapter I
  will discuss the possible method of formation within this blank space of the notochord and midgut.
  Boveri considers that the obliteration of the atrial cavity in the higher vertebrates is not
  complete, but that its presence is still visible in the shape of the pronephric duct. The evidence
  of Maas and others that the duct is formed by the fusion of the pronephric tubules is, it seems to
  me, conclusive against Boveri's view; but yet, as may be seen from my diagrammatic figures, the
  very place where one would expect to find the last remnant of the atrial cavity is exactly where
  the pronephric duct is situated. For my own part I should expect to find evidence of a former
  existence of an atrial cavity rather in the pigment round the pronephros and its duct than in the
  duct itself.</p>

  <p>The conception that Amphioxus shows us how to account for the great envelope of somatic muscles
  which wraps round the vertebrate body, in that the ancestor of the vertebrate possessed on each
  side the body a segmented pleuron, is exactly in accordance with the theory of the origin of
  vertebrates deduced from the study of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, as already set forth in previous chapters.
  For we see that one of the striking characteristics of such forms as Bunodes, Hemiaspis, etc., is
  the presence of segmented pleural flaps on each side of the main part of the body; and if we pass
  further back to the great group of trilobites, we find in the most manifold form, and in various
  degrees of extent, the most markedly segmented pleural folds. In fact, the hypothetical figure
  (Fig. <a href="#fig160">160</a>, A) which I have deduced from the embryological evidence, might
  very well represent a cross-section of a trilobite, provided only that each appendage of the
  trilobite possessed an excretory coxal gland.</p>

  <p>The earliest fishes, then, ought to have possessed segmented pleural folds, which were moved by
  somatic muscles, and enveloped the body after the fashion of Ammoc&#x0153;tes and Amphioxus, and I
  cannot help thinking that Cephalaspis shows, in this respect also, its relation to
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes. It is well known that some of the fossil representatives of the Cephalaspids
  show exceedingly clearly that these animals possessed a very well-segmented body, and it is
  equally recognized that this skeleton is a calcareous, not a bony skeleton, and does not represent
  vertebr√¶, etc. It is generally called an aponeurotic skeleton, meaning thereby that what is
  preserved represents not dermal plates alone, or a vertebrate skeleton, but the calcified septa or
  aponeuroses between a number of muscle-segments or myomeres, precisely of the same kind as the
  septa between the myomeres in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. The termination of such septa on the surface would
  give rise to the appearance of dermal plates or scutes, or the septa may even have been attached
  to something of the nature of dermal plates. The same kind of picture would be represented if
  these connective tissue dissepiments of Ammoc&#x0153;tes were calcified, and the animal then
  fossilized. In agreement with this interpretation of the spinal skeleton of Cephalaspis, it may be
  noted that again and again, in parts of these dissepiments, I have found in old specimens of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes nodules of cartilage formed, and at transformation it is in this very tissue that
  the spinal cartilages are formed.</p>

  <p>Now, the specimens of Cephalaspis all show, as seen in Fig. <a href="#fig161">161</a>, that the
  skeletal septa cover the body regularly, and then along one line are bent away from the body to
  form, as it were, a fringe, or rather a free pleuron, which has been easily pushed at an angle to
  the body-skeleton in the process of fossilization. Patten thinks that this fringed appearance is
  evidence of a number of segmental appendages which were jointed to the corresponding
  body-segments, and in the best specimen at the South Kensington Natural History Museum he thinks
  such joints are clearly visible. He concludes, therefore, that the cephalaspids were arthropods,
  and not vertebrates. I have also carefully examined this specimen, and do not consider that what
  is seen resembles the joint of an arthropod appendage; the appearance is rather such as would be
  produced if the line of attachment of Patten's appendages to the body were the place where the
  pleural body folds became free from the body, and so with any pressure a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page416">{416}</span>bending or fracture of the calcified plates would take place along this
  line. There is, undoubtedly, an appearance of finish at the termination of these skeletal fringes,
  as though they terminated in a definitely shaped spear-like point, just as is seen in the
  trilobite pleur√¶. This, again, to my mind, is rather evidence of pleural fringes than of true
  appendages.</p>

  </div>

  <p>As already argued, I look upon Ammoc&#x0153;tes as the only living fish at all resembling the
  cephalaspids; it is therefore instructive to compare the arrangement of this spinal dermo-septal
  skeleton of Cephalaspis with that of the septa between the myomeres in the trunk-region of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes and Amphioxus. Such a skeleton in Ammoc&#x0153;tes would be represented by a
  series of plates overlapping each other, arranged as in Fig. <a href="#fig162">162</a>, A, and in
  Amphioxus as in Fig. <a href="#fig162">162</a>, B. I have lettered the corresponding parts of the
  two structures by similar letters, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>. Ammoc&#x0153;tes differs in
  configuration from Amphioxus in that it possesses an extra dorsal (<i>a</i>, <i>d</i>) and an
  extra ventral bend. Ammoc&#x0153;tes is a much rounder animal than Amphioxus, and both the dorsal
  and ventral bends are on the extreme ventral and dorsal surfaces&mdash;surfaces which can hardly
  be said to exist in Amphioxus. The part, then, of such an aponeurotic skeleton <span
  class="pagenum" id="page417">{417}</span>in Ammoc&#x0153;tes which I imagine corresponds to
  <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> in Amphioxus, and therefore would represent the pleural fold, is the part
  ventral to the bend at <i>b</i>. In both the animals this bend corresponds to the position of the
  notochord NC.</p>

  <p>The skeleton of Cephalaspis compares more directly with that of Ammoc&#x0153;tes than that of
  Amphioxus, for there is the same extra dorsal bend (Fig. <a href="#fig161">161</a>, <i>a</i>,
  <i>d</i>) as in Ammoc&#x0153;tes; the lateral part of the skeleton again gives an angle <i>a</i>,
  <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>; the part from <i>b</i> to <i>c</i> would therefore represent the pleural fold.
  I picture to myself the sequence of events somewhat as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">First, a protostracan ancestor, which, like Peripatus, possessed appendages on
  every segment into which c&#x0153;lomic diverticula passed, forming a system of coxal glands; such
  glands, being derived from the segmental organs of the Ch√¶topoda, discharged originally to the
  exterior by separate openings on each segment. It is, however, possible, and I think probable,
  that a fusion of these separate ducts had already taken place in the protostracan stage, so that
  there was only one external opening for the whole of these metasomatic coxal glands, just as there
  is only one external opening for the corresponding prosomatic coxal glands of Limulus. Then, by
  the ventral growth of pleural body-folds, such appendages became enclosed and useless, and the
  coxal glands of the post-branchial segments, with their segmental or pronephric duct, were all
  that remained as evidence of such appendages. This dwindling of the metasomatic appendages was
  accompanied by the getting-rid of free appendages generally, in the manner already set forth, with
  the result that a smooth fish-like body-surface was formed; then the necessity of increasing
  mobility brought about elongation by the addition of segments between those last formed and the
  cloacal region. Each of such new-formed segments was appendageless, so that its segmental organ
  was not a coxal gland, but entirely somatic in position, and formed, therefore, a mesonephric
  tubule, not a pronephric one. Such glands could no longer excrete to the exterior, owing to the
  enclosing shell of the pleural folds; but the pronephric duct was there, already formed, and so
  these nephric tubules opened into that, instead of, as in the case of the branchial slits, forcing
  their way through the pleural walls when the atrium became closed.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page418">{418}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Meaning of the Ductless Glands.</span></p>

  <p>If it is a right conception that the excretory organs of the protostracan group, which gave
  origin to the vertebrates as well as to the crustaceans and arachnids, were of the nature of coxal
  glands, then it follows that such coxal glands must have existed originally on every segment,
  because they themselves were derived from the segmental organs of the annelids; it is therefore
  worth while making an attempt to trace the fate of such segmental organs in the vertebrate as well
  as in the crustacean and arachnid.</p>

  <p>Such an attempt is possible, it seems to me, because there exists throughout the animal kingdom
  striking evidence that excretory organs which no longer excrete to the exterior do not disappear,
  but still perform excretory functions of a different character. Their cells still take up effete
  or injurious substances, and instead of excreting to the exterior, excrete into the blood, forming
  either ductless glands of special character, or glands of the nature of lymphatic glands.</p>

  <p>The problem presented to us is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The excretory organs of both arthropods and vertebrates arose from those of annelids, and were
  therefore originally present in every segment of the body. In most arthropods and vertebrates they
  are present only in certain regions; in the former case, as the coxal glands of the prosomatic or
  head-region; in the latter, as the nephric glands of the metasomatic or trunk-region, and, in the
  case of Amphioxus, of the mesosomatic or branchial region.</p>

  <p>In the original arthropod, judging from Peripatus, they were present, as in the annelid, in all
  the segments of the body, and formed coxal glands. Therefore, in the ancestors of the living
  Crustacea and Arachnida, coxal glands must have existed in all the segments of the body, and we
  ought to be able to find the vestiges of them in the mesosomatic or branchial and metasomatic or
  abdominal regions of the body.</p>

  <p>Similarly, in the vertebrates, derived, as has been shown, not from the annelids, but from an
  arthropod stock, evidence of the previous existence of coxal glands ought to be manifested in the
  prosomatic or trigeminal region, in the mesosomatic or branchial region, as well as in the
  metasomatic or post-branchial region.</p>

  <p>How does an excretory organ change its character when it ceases <span class="pagenum"
  id="page419">{419}</span>to excrete to the exterior? What should we look for in our search after
  the lost coxal glands?</p>

  <p>The answer to these questions is most plainly given in the case of the pronephros, especially
  in Myxine, where Maas has been able to follow out the whole process of the conversion of nephric
  tubules into a tissue resembling that of a lymph-gland.</p>

  <p>He states, in the first place, that the pronephros possesses a capillary network, which extends
  over the pronephric duct, while the tubules of the mesonephros possess not only this capillary
  network, equivalent to the capillaries over the convoluted tubules in the higher vertebrates, but
  also a true glomerulus, in that the nephric segmental arteriole forms a coil (Knauel), and pushes
  in the wall of the mesonephric tubule. He describes the pronephros of large adult individuals as
  consisting of&mdash;</p>

  <p>1.  Tubules with funnels which open into the pericardial c&#x0153;lom.</p>

  <p>2.  A large capillary network (the glomus) at the distal end.</p>

  <p>3.  A peculiar tissue (the 'strittige Gewebe' of the Semon-Spengel controversy), which Spengel
  considers to be composed of the altered epithelium of pronephric tubules, while Semon looks on it
  as an amalgamation of glomeruli.</p>

  <p>Maas is entirely on the side of Spengel, and shows that this peculiar tissue is actually formed
  by modified pronephric tubules, which become more and more lymphatic in character.</p>

  <p>He says: "The pronephros consists of a number of nephric tubules, placed separately one behind
  the other, which were originally segmental in character, each one of which is supplied by a
  capillary network from a segmental branch of the aorta. The tubules begin with many mouths
  (dorso-lateral and medial-ventral) in the pericardial cavity; on their other blind end they have
  lost their original external opening, and there, in the cranial portion of the head-kidney, before
  they have joined together to form a collecting duct, they, together with the vascular network, are
  transformed into a peculiar adrenal-like tissue. The most posterior of the segmental capillary
  nets retain their original character, and are concentrated into the separate capillary mass known
  as the glomus."</p>

  <p>Later on he says: "Further, the separate head-kidney is more and more removed in structure from
  an excretory organ in the ordinary sense. One cannot, however, speak of it as an organ becoming
  rudimentary; this is proved not only by the progressive transformation <span class="pagenum"
  id="page420">{420}</span>of its internal tissue into a tissue of a very definite character, but
  also by the cilia in its canals, and the steady increase in the number of its funnels. It appears,
  therefore, to be the conversion of an excretory organ into an organ for the transference of fluid
  out of the c&#x0153;lom into a special tissue, <i>i.e.</i> into its blood-sinus; in other words,
  into an organ which must be classed as belonging to the lymph-system."</p>

  <p>In exact correspondence with this transformation of a nephric tubule into a ductless gland of
  the nature of a lymphatic gland, is the formation of the head-kidney in the Teleostea. Thus,
  Weldon points out that, though the observations of Balfour left it highly probable that the
  "lymphatic" tissue described by him was really a result of the transformation of part of the
  embryonic kidney, he did not investigate the details of its development. This was afterwards done
  by Emery, with the following results: "In those Teleostea which he has studied, Professor Emery
  finds that at an early stage the kidney consists entirely of a single pronephric funnel, opening
  into the pericardium, and connected with the segmental duct, which already opens to the exterior.
  Behind this funnel, the segmental duct is surrounded by a blastema, derived from the intermediate
  cell-mass, which afterwards arranges itself more or less completely into a series of solid cords,
  attaching themselves to the duct. These develop a lumen, and become normal segmental tubules, but
  it is, if I may be allowed the expression, a matter of chance how much of the blastema becomes so
  transformed into kidney tubules, and how much is left as the 'lymphatic' tissue of Balfour, this
  'lymphatic' tissue remaining either in the pronephros only, or in both pro- and <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'neso-'.">meso</span>-nephros."</p>

  <p>If we turn now to the invertebrates, we see also how close a connection exists between
  lymphatic and phagocytic organs and excretory organs. The chief merit for this discovery is due to
  Kowalewsky, who, taking a hint from Heidenhain's work on the kidney, in which he showed how easy
  it was to find out the nature of different parts of the mammalian excretory organ by the injection
  of different substances, such as a solution of ammoniated carmine, or of indigo-carmine, has
  injected into a large number of different invertebrates various colouring matters, or litmus, or
  bacilli, and thus shown the existence, not only of known excretory organs, but also of others,
  lymphatic or lymphoid in nature, not hitherto suspected.</p>

  <p>In all cases he finds that a phagocytic action with respect to solid <span class="pagenum"
  id="page421">{421}</span>bodies is a property of the leucocytes, and that these leucocytes which
  are found in the c&#x0153;lomic spaces of the Annelida, etc., are apparently derived from the
  epithelium of such spaces. Also by the proliferation of such epithelium in places, <i>e.g.</i> the
  septal glands of the terrestrial Oligoch√¶ta, segmental glandular masses of such tissue are formed
  which take up the colouring matter, or the bacilli. In the limicolous Oligoch√¶ta such septal
  glands are not found, but at the commencement of the nephridial organ, immediately following upon
  the funnel, a remarkable modification of the nephridial wall takes place to form a large cellular
  cavernous mass, the so-called filter, which in Euaxes is full of leucocytes; the cells are only
  definable by their nuclei, and look like and act in the same way as the free leucocytes outside
  this nephridial appendage. As G. Schneider points out, the whole arrangement is very like that
  described by Kowalewsky in the leeches Clepsine and Nephelis, where, also immediately succeeding
  the funnel of the nephridial organ, a large accessory organ is found, which is part of the
  nephridium, and is called the nephridial capsule. This is the organ <i>par excellence</i> which
  takes up the solid carmine-grains and bacilli, and apparently, from Kowalewsky's description,
  contains leucocytes in large numbers. We see, then, that in such invertebrates, just as in the
  vertebrate, modifications of the true excretory organ may give rise to phagocytic glands of the
  nature of lymphatic glands. Further, these researches of Kowalewsky suggest in the very strongest
  manner that whenever by such means new, hitherto unsuspected glands are discovered, such glands
  must belong to the excretory system, <i>i.e.</i> must be derived from c&#x0153;lomic epithelium,
  even when all evidence of any c&#x0153;lom has disappeared. Kowalewsky himself was evidently so
  impressed with the same feeling that he heads one of his papers "The Excretory Organs of the
  Pantopoda," although the organs in question had been discovered by him by this method, and
  appeared as ductless glands with no external opening.</p>

  <p>To my mind these observations of Kowalewsky are of exceeding interest, for it is immediately
  clear that if the segmental organs of the annelids, which must have existed on all the segments of
  the forefathers of the Crustacea and Arachnida (the Protostraca), have left any sign of their
  existence in living crustaceans and arachnids, then such indication would most likely take the
  form of lymphatic glands in the places where the excretory organs ought to have been.</p>

  <p>Now, as already pointed out in Peripatus, such segmental organs <span class="pagenum"
  id="page422">{422}</span>were formed by the ventral part of the c&#x0153;lom, and dipped
  originally into each appendage. We know also that each segment of an arachnid embryo possesses a
  c&#x0153;lomic cavity in its ventral part which extends into the appendage on each side; this
  cavity afterwards disappears, and is said to leave no trace in the adult of any excretory coxal
  gland derived from its walls. If, however, it is found that in the very position where such organ
  ought to have been formed a segmentally arranged ductless gland is situated, the existence of
  which is shown by its taking up carmine, etc., then it seems to me that in all probability such
  gland is the modification of the original coxal gland.</p>

  <p>This is what Kowalewsky has done. Thus he states that Metschnikoff had fed Mysis with
  carmine-grains, and found tubules at the base of the thoracic feet coloured red with carmine. He
  himself used an allied species, <i>Parapodopsis cornutum</i>, and found here also that the carmine
  was taken up by tubules situated in the basal segments of the feet. In Nebalia, feeding
  experiments with alizarin blue and carmine stained the antennal glands, and showed the existence
  of glands at the base of the eight thoracic feet. These glands resemble the foot-glands of Mysis,
  Parapodopsis, and Pal√¶mon, and lie in the space through which the blood passes from the thoracic
  feet, <i>i.e.</i> from the gills, to the heart. In Squilla also, in addition to the shell-glands,
  special glands were discovered on the branchial feet on the path of the blood to the heart. These
  glands form continuous masses of cells which constitute large compact glands at the base of the
  branchial feet. Single cells of the same sort are found along the whole course of the branchial
  venous canal, right up to the pericardium.</p>

  <p>These observations show that the Crustacea possess not only true excretory organs in the shape
  of coxal glands, <i>i.e.</i> antennary glands, shell-glands, etc., in the cephalic region, but
  also a series of segmental glands situated at the base of the appendages, especially of the
  respiratory appendages: a system, that is to say, of coxal glands which have lost their excretory
  function, through having lost their external opening, but have not in consequence disappeared, but
  still remain <i>in situ</i>, and still retain an important excretory function, having become
  lymphatic glands containing leucocytes. Such glands are especially found in the branchial
  appendages, and are called branchial glands by Cu√©not, who describes them for all Decapoda.</p>

  <p>Further, it is significant that the same method reveals the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page423">{423}</span>existence in Pantopoda of a double set of glands of similar character,
  one set in the basal segments of the appendage, and the other in the adjacent part of the
  body.</p>

  <p>In scorpions also, Kowalewsky has shown that the remarkable lymphatic organ situated along the
  whole length of the nerve-cord in the abdominal region takes up carmine grains and bacilli; an
  organ which in Androctonus does not form one continuous gland, but a number of separate,
  apparently irregularly grouped, glandular bodies.</p>

  <p>In addition to this median lymphatic gland, Kowalewsky has discovered in the scorpion a pair of
  lateral glands, to which he gives the name of lymphoid glands, which communicate with the thoracic
  body-cavity (<i>i.e.</i> the pseudoc&#x0153;le), are phagocytic, and, according to him, give
  origin to leucocytes by the proliferation of their lining cells, thus, as he remarks, reminding us
  of the nephridial capsules of Clepsine. These glands are so closely related in position to the
  coxal glands on each side that he has often thought that the lumen of the gland communicated with
  that of the coxal gland; he, however, has persuaded himself that there is no true communication
  between the two glands. Neither of these organs appears to be segmental, and until we know how
  they are developed it is not possible to say whether they represent fused segmental organs or
  not.</p>

  <p>The evidence, then, is very strong that in the Crustacea and Arachnida the original segmental
  excretory organs do not disappear, but remain as ductless glands, of the nature of lymphatic
  glands, which supply leucocytes to the system.</p>

  <p>Further, the evidence shows that the nephric organs, or parts of the c&#x0153;lom in close
  connection with these organs, may be transformed into ductless glands, which do not necessarily
  contain free leucocytes as do lymph-glands, but yet are of such great importance as excretory
  organs that their removal profoundly modifies the condition of the animal. Such a gland is the
  so-called adrenal or suprarenal body, disease of which is a feature of Addison's disease; a gland
  which forms and presumably passes into the blood a substance of remarkable power in causing
  contraction of blood-vessels, a substance which has lately been prepared in crystalline form by
  Jokichi Takamine, and called by him "adrenalin"; a gland, therefore, of very distinctly peculiar
  properties, which cannot be regarded as rudimentary, but is of vital importance for the due
  maintenance of the healthy state.</p>

  <p>In the Elasmobranchs two separate glandular organs have been <span class="pagenum"
  id="page424">{424}</span>called suprarenal; a segmental series of paired organs, each of which
  possesses a branch from the aorta and a sympathetic ganglion, and an unpaired series in close
  connection with the kidneys, to which Balfour gave the name of interrenal glands. Of these two
  sets of glands, Swale Vincent has shown that the extract of the interrenals has no marked
  physiological effect, in this respect resembling the extract of the cortical part of the mammalian
  gland, while the extract of the paired segmental organs of the Elasmobranch produces the same
  remarkable rise of blood-pressure as the extract of the medullary portion of the mammalian
  gland.</p>

  <p>The development also of these two sets of glands is asserted to be different. Balfour
  considered that the suprarenals were derived from sympathetic ganglion-cells, but left the origin
  of the interrenals doubtful. Weldon showed that the cortical part of the suprarenals in the lizard
  was derived from the wall of the glomerulus of a number of mesonephric tubules. In Pristiurus, he
  stated that the mesoblastic rudiment described by Balfour as giving origin to the interrenals is
  derived from a diverticulum of each segmental tubule, close to the narrowing of its funnel-shaped
  opening into the body-cavity. With respect to the paired suprarenals he was unable to speak
  positively, but doubted whether they were derived entirely from sympathetic ganglia.</p>

  <p>Weldon sums up the results of his observations by saying: "That all vertebrates except
  Amphioxus have a portion of the kidney modified for some unknown purpose not connected with
  excretion; that in Cyclostomes the pronephros alone is so modified, in Teleostei the pro- and part
  of the meso-nephros; while in the Elasmobranchs and the higher vertebrates the mesonephros alone
  gives rise to this organ, which has also in these forms acquired a secondary connection with
  certain of the sympathetic ganglia."</p>

  <p>Since Weldon's paper, a large amount of literature on the origin of the adrenals has appeared,
  a summary of which, up to 1891, is given by Hans Rabl in his paper, and a further summary by
  Aichel in his paper published in 1900. The result of the investigations up to this latter paper
  may be summed up by saying that the adrenals, using this term to include all these organs of
  whatever kind, are in all cases, partly at all events, derived from some part of the walls of
  either the mesonephric or pronephric excretory organs, but that in addition a separate origin from
  the sympathetic nervous system must <span class="pagenum" id="page425">{425}</span>be ascribed to
  the medullary part of the organ and to the separate paired organs in the Elasmobranchs, which are
  equivalent to the medullary part in other cases.</p>

  <p>The evidence, then, of the transformation of the known vertebrate excretory organs&mdash;the
  pronephros and the mesonephros&mdash;leads to the conclusion that in our search for the missing
  coxal glands of the meso- and pro-somatic regions, we must look for either lymphatic glands, or
  ductless glands of distinct importance to the body. I have already considered the question in the
  prosomatic region, and have given my reasons why the pituitary gland must be looked upon as the
  descendant of the arthropod coxal gland. In this case also the resulting ductless gland is still
  of functional importance, for disease of it is associated with acromegaly. If, as is possible, it
  is homologous with the Ascidian hypophysial gland, then it is confirmatory evidence that this
  latter is said by Julin to be an altered nephridial organ.</p>

  <p>Finally, I come to the mesosomatic or branchial region; and here, strikingly enough, we find a
  perfectly segmental glandular organ of mysterious origin&mdash;the thymus gland&mdash;segmental
  with the branchi√¶, not necessarily with the myotomes, belonging, therefore, to the appendicular
  system; and since the branchi√¶ represent, according to my theory, the basal part of the appendage,
  such segmental glands would be in the position of coxal glands. Here, then, in the thymus may be
  the missing mesosomatic coxal glands.</p>

  <p>What, then, is the thymus?</p>

  <p>The answer to this question has been given recently by Beard, who strongly confirms K√∂lliker's
  original view that the thymus is a gland for the manufacture of leucocytes, and that such
  leucocytes are directly derived from the epithelial cells of the thymus. K√∂lliker also further
  pointed out that the blood of the embryo is for a certain period destitute of leucocytes. Beard
  confirms this last statement, and says that up to a certain stage (varying from 10 to 16 mm. in
  length of the embryo) the embryos of <i>Raja batis</i> have no leucocytes in the blood or
  elsewhere. Up to this period the thymus-placode is well formed, and the first leucocytes can be
  seen to be formed in it from its epithelial cells; then such formation takes place with great
  rapidity, and soon an enormous discharge of leucocytes occurs from the thymus into the
  tissue-spaces and blood. He therefore concludes that all lymphoid tissues in the body arise
  originally from the thymus gland, <i>i.e.</i> from leucocytes discharged from the thymus.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page426">{426}</span></div>

  <p>The segmental branchial glands, known by the name of thymus, are, according to this view, the
  original lymphatic glands of the vertebrate; and it is to be noted that, in fishes and in
  Amphibia, lymphatic glands, such as we know them in the higher mammals, do not exist; they are
  characteristic of the higher stages of vertebrate evolution. In the lower vertebrates, the only
  glandular masses apart from the cell-lining of the body-cavity itself, which give rise to
  leucocyte-forming tissue, are these segmental branchial glands, or possibly also the modified
  post-branchial segmental glands, known as the head-kidney in Teleostea, etc.</p>

  <p>The importance ascribed by Beard to the thymus in the formation of leucocytes in the lowest
  vertebrates would be considerably reduced in value if the branchial region of Ammoc&#x0153;tes
  possessed neither thymus glands nor anything equivalent to them. Such, however, is not the case.
  Schaffer has shown that in the young Ammoc&#x0153;tes masses of lymphatic glandular tissue are
  found segmentally arranged in the neighbourhood of each gill-slit&mdash;tissue which soon becomes
  converted into a swarming mass of leucocytes, and shows by its staining, etc., how different it is
  from a blood-space. The presence of this thymus leucocyte-forming tissue, as described by
  Schaffer, is confirmed by Beard, and I myself have seen the same thing in my youngest specimen of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>Further, the very methods by which Kowalewsky has brought to light the segmental lymph-glands
  of the branchial region of the Crustacea, etc., are the same as those by which Weiss discovered
  the branchial nephric glands in Amphioxus&mdash;excretory organs which Boveri considers to
  represent the pronephros of the Craniota. In this supposition Boveri is right, in so far that both
  pronephros and the tubules in Amphioxus belong to the same system of excretory organs; but I
  entirely agree with van Wijhe that the region in Amphioxus is wrong. The tubules in Amphioxus
  ought to be represented in the branchial region of the Craniota, not in the post-branchial region;
  van Wijhe therefore suggests that further researches may homologize them with the thymus gland in
  the Craniota, not with the pronephros. This suggestion of van Wijhe appears to me a remarkably
  good one, especially in view of the position of the thymus glands in Ammoc&#x0153;tes and the
  nephric branchial glands in Amphioxus. If, as I have pointed out, the atrial cavity of Amphioxus
  has been closed in Ammoc&#x0153;tes by the apposition of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page427">{427}</span>the pleural fold with the branchial body-surface, then the remains of the
  position of the atrial chamber must exist in Ammoc&#x0153;tes as that extraordinary space between
  the somatic muscles and the branchial basket-work filled with blood-spaces and modified
  muco-cartilage. It is in this very space, close against the gill-slits, that the thymus glands of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes are found, in the very place where the nephric tubules of Amphioxus would be
  found if its atrial cavity were closed completely. Instead, therefore, of considering with Boveri
  that the branchial nephric tubules of Amphioxus still exist in the Craniota as the pronephros, and
  that the atrial chamber has narrowed down to the pronephric duct, I would agree with van Wijhe
  that the pronephros is post-branchial, and suggest that by the complete closure of the atrial
  space in the branchial region the branchial nephric tubules have lost all external opening, and
  consequently, as in all other cases, have changed into lymphatic tissue and become the segmental
  thymus glands.</p>

  <p>As van Wijhe himself remarks, the time is hardly ripe for making any positive statement about
  the relationship between the thymus gland and branchial excretory organs. There is at present not
  sufficient consensus of opinion to enable us to speak with any certainty on the subject, yet there
  is so much suggestiveness in the various statements of different authors as to make it worth while
  to consider the question briefly.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, thymus, tonsils, parathyroids, epithelial cell-nests, and parathymus, are all
  stated to be derivatives of the epithelium lining the gill-slits, and Maurer would draw a
  distinction between the organs derived from the dorsal side of the gill-cleft and those derived
  from the ventral side&mdash;the former being thymus, the latter forming the epithelial cell-nests,
  <i>i.e.</i> parathyroids. The thymus in Ammoc&#x0153;tes, according to Schaffer, lies both ventral
  and dorsal to the gill-cleft; Maurer thinks that only the dorsal part corresponds to the thymus,
  the ventral part corresponding to the parathyroids, etc. Structurally, the thymus, parathyroids,
  and the epithelial cell-nests are remarkably similar, so that the evidence appears to point to the
  conclusion that, in the neighbourhood of the gill-slits, segmentally arranged organs of a
  lymphatic character are situated, which give origin to the thymus, parathyroids, tonsils, etc.
  Now, among these organs, <i>i.e.</i> among those ventrally situated, Maurer places the carotid
  gland, so that, if he is right, the origin of the carotid gland <span class="pagenum"
  id="page428">{428}</span>might be expected to help in the elucidation of the origin of the
  thymus.</p>

  <p>The origin of the carotid gland has been investigated recently by Kohn, who finds that it is
  associated with the sympathetic nervous system in the same way as the suprarenals. He desires, in
  fact, to make a separate category for such nerve-glands, or paraganglia, as he calls them, and
  considers them all to be derivatives of the sympathetic nervous system, and to have nothing to do
  with excretory organs. The carotid gland is, according to him, the foremost of the suprarenal
  masses in the Elasmobranchs, viz. the so-called axillary heart.</p>

  <p>In my opinion, nests of sympathetic ganglion-cells necessarily mean the supply of efferent
  fibres to some organ, for all such ganglia are efferent, and also, if they are found in the organ,
  would have been brought into it by way of the blood-vessels supplying the organ, so that Aichel's
  statement of the origin of the suprarenals in the Elasmobranchs seems to me much more probable
  than a derivation from nerve-cells. If, then, it prove that Aichel is right as to the origin of
  the suprarenals, and Kohn is right in classifying the carotid gland with the suprarenals, then
  Maurer's statements would bring the parathyroids, thymus, etc., into line with the adrenals, and
  suggest that they represent the segmented glandular excretory organs of the branchial region, into
  which, just as in the interrenals of Elasmobranchs, or the cortical part of the adrenals of the
  higher vertebrates, there has been no invasion of sympathetic ganglion-cells.</p>

  <p>Wheeler makes a most suggestive remark in his paper on Petromyzon: he thinks he has obtained
  evidence of serial homologues of the pronephric tubules in the branchial region of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, but has not been able up to the present to follow them out. If what he thinks to
  be serial homologues of the pronephric tubules in the branchial region should prove to be the
  origin of the thymus glands of Schaffer, then van Wijhe's suggestion that the thymus represents
  the excretory organs of the branchial region would gain enormously in probability. Until some such
  further investigation has been undertaken, I can only say that it seems to me most likely that the
  thymus, etc., represent the lymphatic branchial glands of the Crustacea, and therefore represent
  the missing coxal glands of the branchial region.</p>

  <p>This, however, is not all, for the appendages of the mesosomatic region, as I have shown, do
  not all bear branchi√¶; the foremost or <span class="pagenum" id="page429">{429}</span>opercular
  appendage carries the thyroid gland. Again, the basal part of the appendage is all that is left;
  the thyroid gland is in position a coxal gland. It ought, therefore, to represent the coxal gland
  of this appendage, just as the thymus, tonsils, etc., represent the coxal glands of the rest of
  the mesosomatic appendages. In the thyroid gland we again see a ductless gland of immense
  importance to the economy, not a useless organ, but one, like the other modified coxal glands,
  whose removal involves far-reaching vital consequences. Such a gland, on my theory, was in the
  arthropod a part of the external genital ducts which opened on the basal joint of the operculum.
  What, then, is the opinion of morphologists as to the meaning of these external genital ducts?</p>

  <p>In a note to Gulland's paper on the coxal glands of Limulus, Lankester states that the
  conversion of an externally-opening tubular gland (coxal gland) into a ductless gland is the same
  kind of thing as the history of the development of the suprarenal from a modified portion of
  mesonephros, as given by Weldon. Further, that in other arthropods with glands of a tubular
  character opening to the exterior at the base of the appendages, we also have coxal nephridia,
  such as the shell-glands of the Entomostraca, green glands of Crustacea (antennary coxal gland);
  and further on he writes: "When once the notion is admitted that ducts opening at the base of
  limbs in the Arthropoda are possibly and even probably modified nephridia, we immediately conceive
  the hypothesis that the genital ducts of the Arthropoda are modified nephridia."</p>

  <p>So, also, Korschelt and Heider, in their general summing up on the Arthropoda, say: "In
  Peripatus, where the nephridia appear, as in the Annelida, in all the trunk-segments, a
  considerable portion of the primitive segments is directly utilized for the formation of the
  nephridia. In the other groups, the whole question of the rise of the organs known as nephridia is
  still undecided, but it may be mentioned as very probable that the salivary and anal glands of
  Peripatus, the antennal and shell-glands of the Crustacea, the coxal glands of Limulus and the
  Arachnida, as well as the efferent genital ducts, are derived from nephridia, and in any case are
  mesodermal in origin."</p>

  <p>The necessary corollary to this exceedingly probable argument is that glandular structures such
  as the uterine glands of the scorpion already described, which are found in connection with these
  terminal <span class="pagenum" id="page430">{430}</span>genital ducts, may be classed as modified
  nephridial glands, and that therefore the thyroid gland of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, which, on the theory
  of this book, arose in connection with the opercular genital ducts of the pal√¶ostracan ancestor,
  represents the coxal glands of this fused pair of appendages. Such a gland, although its function
  in connection with the genital organs had long disappeared, still, in virtue of its original
  excretory function, persisted, and even in the higher vertebrates, after it had lost all semblance
  of its former structure and become a ductless gland of an apparently rudimentary nature, still, by
  its excretory function, demonstrates its vital importance even to the highest vertebrate.</p>

  <p>By this simple explanation we see how these hitherto mysterious ductless glands, pituitary,
  thymus, tonsils, thyroid, are all accounted for, are all members of a common stock&mdash;coxal
  glands&mdash;which originally, as in Peripatus, excreted at the base of the prosomatic and
  mesosomatic appendages, and are still retained because of the importance of their excretory
  function, although ductless owing to the modification of their original appendages.</p>

  <p>Finally, there is yet another organ in the vertebrate which follows the same law of the
  conversion of an excretory organ into a lymphatic organ when its connection with the exterior is
  obliterated, and that is the vertebrate body-cavity itself. According to the scheme here put
  forth, the body-cavity of the vertebrate arose by the fusion of a ventral prolongation of the
  original nephroc&#x0153;le on each side; prolongations which accompanied the formation of the new
  ventral midgut, and by their fusion formed originally a pair of cavities along the whole length of
  the abdomen, being separated from each other by the ventral mesentery of the gut. Subsequently, by
  the ventral fusion of these two cavities, the body-cavity of the adult vertebrate was formed.</p>

  <p>This is simply a statement of the known method of formation of the body-cavity in the embryo,
  and its phylogenetic explanation is that the body-cavity of the vertebrate must be looked upon as
  a ventral prolongation of the original ancestral body-cavity. Embryology clearly teaches that the
  original body-cavity or somite was confined to the region of the notochord and central nervous
  system, and there, just as in Peripatus, was divisible into a dorsal part, giving origin to the
  myoc&#x0153;le, and a ventral part, forming the nephroc&#x0153;le. From this original
  nephroc&#x0153;le are formed the pronephric excretory organs, the mesonephric excretory organs,
  and the body-cavity.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page431">{431}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">That the vertebrate body-cavity was originally a nephroc&#x0153;le is generally
  accepted, and its excretory function is shown by the fact that it communicates with the exterior
  in all the lower vertebrates, either through abdominal pores or by way of nephridial funnels. Bles
  has shown how largely these two methods of communicating with the exterior mutually exclude each
  other. In the higher vertebrates both channels become closed, except in the case of the Fallopian
  tubes, and thus, so to speak, the body-cavity becomes a ductless gland, still, however, with an
  excretory function, but now, as in all other cases, forming a part of the lymphatic rather than of
  the true excretory system.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>The consideration of the formation of the vertebrate cranial region, as set forth in previous
    chapters, indicates that the ancestor of the vertebrates was not an arachnid purely or a
    crustacean purely, but possessed partly crustacean and partly arachnid characters. In order to
    express this conclusion, I have used the term Protostraca, invented by Korschelt and Heider, to
    indicate a primitive arthropod group, from which both arachnids and crustaceans may be supposed
    to have arisen, and have therefore stated that the vertebrate did not arise directly from the
    annelids, but from the Protostraca. Such an origin signifies that the origin of the excretory
    organs of the vertebrate must not be looked for in the segmental organs of the annelid, but
    rather in such modified annelid organs as would naturally exist in a primitive arthropod group.
    The nature of such organs may be inferred, owing to the fortunate circumstance that so primitive
    an arthropod as Peripatus still exists, and we may conclude that the protostracan ancestor
    possessed in every segment a pair of appendages and a pair of c&#x0153;lomic cavities, which
    extended into the base of these appendages. The ventral portion of each of these c&#x0153;lomic
    cavities separated off from the dorsal and formed a nephroc&#x0153;le, giving origin to a
    segmental excretory organ, which, seeing that its end-vesicle was in the base of the appendage,
    and seeing also the nature of the known arachnid and crustacean excretory organs, may fitly be
    termed a coxal gland. This, then, is the working hypothesis to explain the difficulties
    connected with the origin of the pronephros and mesonephros&mdash;that the original segmental
    organs were coxal glands, and therefore indicated the presence of appendages. This hypothesis
    leads to the following conclusions<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>
    <p>1. The coxal glands belonging to the post-branchial appendages of the invertebrate ancestor
    are represented by the pronephric tubules, and existed over the whole metasomatic region.</p>
    <p>2. Such glands discharged into a common duct&mdash;the pronephric duct&mdash;which opened
    into the cloacal region, either in the protostracan stage, when the metasomatic appendages were
    still in existence, just as the coxal glands of the prosomatic region in Limulus discharge into
    a common duct, or else the pronephric duct was formed when the appendages were obliterated.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="page432">{432}</span></div>
    <p>3. The metasomatic appendages disappeared owing to their enclosure by pleural folds, which,
    meeting in the mid-ventral line, not only caused the obliteration of the appendages, and gave a
    smooth fish-like body-surface to the animal, but also caused the formation of an atrial
    cavity.</p>
    <p>4. Into these pleural folds the dorsal longitudinal muscles of the body extended, and
    ultimately reached to the ventral surface, thus forming the somatic muscles of the vertebrate
    body.</p>
    <p>5. When the pleural folds had met in the mid-ventral line the animal had <span
    class="correction" title="Original reads 'became'">become</span> a vertebrate, and was dependent
    for its locomotion on the movements of these somatic muscles, and not on the movements of
    appendages. Consequently, elongation of the trunk-region took place, for the purpose of
    increasing mobility, by the formation of new metameres.</p>
    <p>6. Each of such metameres possessed its own segmental excretory organ, formed in the same way
    as the previous pronephric organs, but, as there were no appendages in these new-formed
    segments, the excretory organs took on the characters of a mesonephros, not a pronephros, and
    opened into the pronephric duct, because the direct way to the exterior was blocked by the
    enveloping pleural folds.</p>
    <p>7. The group of annelids from which the protostracan ancestor of the vertebrates arose was
    the highest annelidan group, viz. the Polych√¶ta, as shown by the nature of the excretory organs
    in Amphioxus.</p>
    <p>8. The coxal glands of the protostracan ancestor existed on all the segments, and were,
    therefore, divisible into three groups, prosomatic, mesosomatic, and metasomatic; these three
    groups of coxal glands still exist in the vertebrate as ductless glands.</p>
    <p>9. The prosomatic coxal glands form the pituitary body.</p>
    <p>10. The mesosomatic coxal glands form the thymus, thyroid, parathyroids, tonsils, etc.</p>
    <p>11. The metasomatic coxal glands form the adrenals.</p>
    <p>12. The proc&#x0153;lom of the vertebrate is the proc&#x0153;lom of the protostracan
    ancestor, which splits into a dorsal part, the myoc&#x0153;le, and a ventral part, the
    nephroc&#x0153;le. This latter part not only forms the pronephros and mesonephros, but also by a
    ventral extension gives origin to the walls of the vertebrate body-cavity or
    metac&#x0153;le.</p>
    <p class="sp0">13. This ventral extension of the original nephroc&#x0153;le at first excreted to
    the exterior, through abdominal pores, or through peritoneal funnels. When such paths to the
    exterior became closed, it also became a ductless gland, belonging to the lymphatic system.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the previous chapters all the important organs of the arthropod have been found in the
  vertebrate in their appropriate place, of similar structure, and innervated from corresponding
  parts of the central nervous system. Such comparison is possible only as long as the ventral and
  dorsal surfaces of the vertebrate correspond with the respective surfaces of the arthropod, and no
  reversal is assumed. This method of comparative anatomy is the surest and most certain guide to
  the relationship between two animals, and when the facts obtained by the anatomical method are so
  strikingly confirmatory of the pal√¶ontological evidence, the combined evidence becomes so strong
  as to amount almost to a certainty that vertebrates did arise from arthropods in the manner mapped
  out in previous chapters, and not from a hypothetical group of animals, such as is postulated in
  the theory of their origin from forms like Balanoglossus.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The latter theory derives the alimentary canal of the vertebrate from that of the
  invertebrate, and finds in the latter the commencement of the notochord. In the comparison which I
  have made the alimentary canal of the invertebrate ancestor has become the tube of the central
  nervous system of the vertebrate, and there is no sign of a notochord whatever. All the organs of
  the arthropod have already been allocated; where the notochord is situated in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page434">{434}</span>vertebrate there is nothing but a gap in the
  invertebrate, but the position of that gap can be settled with great accuracy from the previous
  comparison of organs in the two groups. So, also, the alimentary canal of the vertebrate is from
  the very nature of the case a new organ, yet, as has been shown in Chapter V., the comparison of
  the respiratory organs in the two groups gives a strong suggestion of the manner in which such a
  canal was formed.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Origin of the Notochord.</span></p>

  <p>The time has now come to endeavour to frame a plausible theory of the method of formation of
  the notochord and the new alimentary canal, and thus to complete the diagram on p. <a
  href="#page413">413</a>. The comparative method is no longer available, for these structures are
  both unrepresented as such in the arthropod; any suggested explanation, therefore, must be more
  tentative, and cannot give the same feeling of certainty as is the case with all the organs
  already considered. Our only chance of finding out the past history of the notochord lies in the
  embryological method, in the hope that, according to the 'law of recapitulation,' the ancestral
  history may be repeated in the ontogeny with sufficient clearness to enable some conclusion to be
  drawn.</p>

  <p>At the outset, one point comes out clearly&mdash;the close relationship between the notochord
  and the vertebrate gut; they are both derived from the same layer, both parts of the same
  structure. On this point all embryologists are agreed; it is expressed in such statements as, "the
  notochord, as well as the alimentary canal, is formed from hypoblast"; "the notochord arises as a
  thickening in the dorsal wall of the alimentary canal." The two structures are so closely
  connected together that they must be considered together. If we can conjecture the origin of the
  one, we may be sure that we have the clue to the origin of the other. The two together form the
  one new organ which distinguishes the vertebrate from the arthropod, the only thing left which
  requires explanation for the completion of this strange history.</p>

  <p>What, then, is the notochord? What are its characteristics? In the highest vertebrates it is
  conspicuous only in the embryo; with the development of the axial skeleton it is more and more
  squeezed out of existence, until in the adult it is no longer visible. By the 'law of
  recapitulation' this developmental history implies that, as we descend the vertebrate phylum, the
  notochord ought to be more and <span class="pagenum" id="page435">{435}</span>more conspicuous,
  more and more permanent during the life of the animal. Such is, indeed, found to be the case,
  until at last, in the lowest vertebrates, such as the lamprey, and in forms like Amphioxus, the
  notochord persists throughout the life of the animal as a large important axial supporting
  rod.</p>

  <p>This rod has a number of striking characteristics which distinguish it from all other
  structures, and are the only means of guessing its probable origin. Its position in the body is
  always the same in all vertebrates and is very significant, for it lies just ventrally to the
  central nervous system, along nearly the whole length of the animal, not quite the whole length,
  for it invariably terminates close to the place where the infundibulum comes to the surface of the
  brain; it is, in fact, always confined to the infra-infundibular and spinal cord part of the
  central nervous system. Interpreting this into the language of the arthropod, it means that a rod
  was formed just ventrally to the nervous system, which extended the whole length of the
  infra&#x0153;sophageal and ventral chain of ganglia, and terminated at the orifice of the mouth.
  Moreover, this rod was unsegmented, for the notochord is devoid of segmentation.</p>

  <p>At the anterior end the rod tapers to a point, as in Fig. <a href="#fig166">166</a>. In its
  middle part it is very large and conspicuous, cylindrical in shape; its interior is filled with a
  peculiar vacuolated tissue, different to any other known vertebrate tissue, which has therefore
  received the name of notochordal tissue. Outside this is a thick sheath formed of many layers, of
  which the external one gives the staining reactions of elastin, and is called the external elastic
  layer. Between this sheath and the notochordal tissue a thin layer of lining cells, of normal
  appearance, is conspicuous in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. These cells secrete the layers of the sheath, and
  have originally, by proliferation, given rise to the notochordal tissue. In the notochord of
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes there is no sign of either nerves, blood-vessels, or muscles.</p>

  <p>The centre of the notochord presents the appearance of a slight slit, as though it had
  originated from a tube, and that is the opinion now generally held, for its mode of formation in
  the embryo is as that of a tube formed from an open groove, as will be explained immediately.</p>

  <p>We may, then, conceive of the notochord as originally a tube lying in the mid-line just
  ventrally to the central nervous system, and extending from the original mouth to the end of the
  body. Translate this into the language of the arthropod and it denotes a tube on the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page436">{436}</span>mid-ventral surface of the body, which extended from
  mouth to anus. Such a tube might be formed from the mid-ventral surface as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig163">163</a>, A, the lining of the ventral surface between two appendages
  is represented flat, in B is shown how the formation of a solid rod may arise from the bulging of
  that ventral surface, and in C how a groove on that surface may lead to the formation of a tube
  between the two appendages. The difference between a notochordal rod formed as in B from that in C
  would be shown in the sheath, for in B the sheath would be formed from the cuticle of the lining
  cells, and in C from the basement membrane. The structure of the sheath is in accordance with the
  embryological evidence that the notochord is formed as a tube from a groove, as in C, and not as a
  solid rod as in B, for it possesses a well-marked elastin layer, and elastin has never yet been
  found as a constituent of any cuticular secretion, but invariably in connection with
  basement-membranes.</p>

  <div class="ac w35 fcenter sp2">

  <p>The position, then, of the notochord and its method of formation suggests that the mid-ventral
  surface of the arthropod ancestor of the vertebrate formed a deep groove between the bases of all
  the prosomatic, mesosomatic, and metasomatic appendages, which was subsequently converted into a
  tube extending along the whole of the body between mouth and anus, and finally, by the
  proliferation of its lining cells and their conversion into notochordal tissue, became the
  notochordal rod of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>As already frequently stated, Apus and Branchipus are the two living arthropods which most
  nearly resemble the extinct trilobites. The beautiful specimens of Triarthrus (Fig. <a
  href="#fig165">165</a>) found by Beecher give an idea of the under surface of the trilobite such
  as has never been obtained before, and demonstrate how closely the condition of things found in
  Apus (Fig. <a href="#fig164">164</a>) was similar to that occurring in the trilobites. In both
  cases the mid-ventral surface of the animal formed a deep groove which extended the whole length
  of the <span class="pagenum" id="page437">{437}</span>animal; on each side of this groove in Apus
  are closely set the gnatho-bases of the appendages, in such a manner that the groove can be easily
  converted into a canal by the movements of these bases&mdash;a canal which, owing to the great
  number of the appendages and their closeness to each other, can be completely and efficiently
  closed.</p>

  <p>All those who have seen Apus in the living state assert that this canal so formed is actually
  used by the animal for feeding purposes. By the movements of the gnatho-bases food is passed up
  from the hind end of the animal along the whole length of this ventral canal to the mouth, where
  it is taken in and swallowed. In this way Apus has been seen to swallow its own eggs.</p>

  <p>In the trilobites there is a similar deep channel formed by the mid-ventral surface, similar
  gnatho-bases, and closely set appendages, and the membrane of this ventral groove was extremely
  thin.</p>

  <p>Here, then, in the very group of animals which were the progenitors of the presumed
  pal√¶ostracan ancestor of the vertebrate&mdash;a group which is characterized by its extensive
  prevalence and its <span class="pagenum" id="page438">{438}</span>enormous variety of form during
  the great trilobite era&mdash;the formation of a mid-ventral canal out of this deep ventral groove
  is seen to be not only easy to imagine, but most probable, provided that a necessity arose for
  such a conversion.</p>

  <p>For what purpose might such a tube have been formed? I would suggest that it might have acted
  as an accessory food-channel, which was of sufficient value at the time to give some advantage in
  the struggle for existence to those members of the group who were thus able to supplement their
  intake of food, but at the same time was so inefficient that it was quickly superseded by the new
  alimentary canal, and thus losing its temporary function, became solid, and was utilized to form
  an axial supporting rod.</p>

  <p>There is a very considerable amount of evidence in favour of the view that the notochord was
  originally a digestive tube; in fact, as far as I know, this conclusion is universally accepted.
  The evidence is based essentially upon its development and upon its structure. It is formed in the
  vertebrate from the same layer as the alimentary canal, <i>i.e.</i> the hypoblast, and in
  Amphioxus it commences as a groove in the dorsal wall of the future alimentary canal; this groove
  then closes to form the tube of the notochord, and separates from the alimentary canal.
  Embryologically, then, the notochord is looked upon as a tube formed directly from the alimentary
  canal.</p>

  <p>As regards its structure, its tissue is, as already stated, something <i>sui generis</i>.
  Notochordal tissue has no resemblance to bone or cartilage, or any of the usual supporting
  tissues. Such a tissue is not, however, entirely confined to the notochord of the vertebrates, but
  tissue closely resembling it has been found not only in Amphioxus and the Tunicata, but in certain
  other invertebrates, in the Enteropneusta (Balanoglossus, etc.), in Cephalodiscus, and in
  Actinotrocha. In all these latter cases, such a tissue is invariably found in disused portions of
  the alimentary canal; a diverticulum of the alimentary canal becomes closed, vacuolation of its
  lining cells takes place, and a tissue resembling notochordal tissue is formed.</p>

  <p>Owing to the notochord being invariably so striking and mysterious a feature of the lowest
  vertebrates, the term vertebrate, which is inappropriate in the members of the group which do not
  yet possess vertebr√¶, has been largely superseded by the term chordate, with the result of
  attributing an undue preponderance to this tissue in any system of classification. Hence, wherever
  any animal has been found <span class="pagenum" id="page439">{439}</span>with a tissue resembling
  that of the notochord, enthusiasts have immediately jumped to the conclusion that a relationship
  must exist between it and the chordate animals; and, accordingly, they have classified such
  animals as follows: Amphioxus belongs to the group <i>Cephalochorda</i> because the notochord
  projects beyond the central nervous system; the Tunicata are called <i>Urochorda</i> because it is
  confined to the tail; the Enteropneusta, <i>Hemichorda</i>, because this tissue is confined to a
  small diverticulum of the gut, and, finally, <i>Diplochorda</i> has been suggested for
  Actinotrocha and Phoronis because two separate portions of the gut are transformed in this
  way.</p>

  <p>This exaggerated importance given to any tissue resembling in structure that of the notochord
  is believed in by many of those who profess to be our teachers on this subject, the very men who
  can deliberately shut their eyes to the plain reading of the story of the pineal eyes, and say,
  "In our opinion this pineal organ was not an eye at all."</p>

  <p>The only legitimate inference to be drawn from the similarity of structure between the
  notochord and these degenerated gut-diverticula, is that the structure of the notochord may have
  arisen in the same way, and that therefore the notochord may once have functioned as a gut. With
  cessation of its function its cells became vacuolated, as in these other cases, and its lumen
  became filled with notochordal tissue. This evidence strongly confirms the suggestion that the
  notochord was once a digestive tube, but by no means signifies that such tissue, wherever found,
  indicates the presence of a notochord.</p>

  <p>In order to resemble a notochord, this tissue must possess not only a definite structure but a
  definite position, and this position is a remarkably striking and suggestive one. The notochordal
  tube is unsegmented, although the vertebrate is markedly segmented. But in all segmented animals
  the only unsegmented tube which extends the whole length of the body, from mouth to anus, is
  invariably the gut. In the vertebrate there are three such tubes: (1) the gut itself, (2) the
  central canal of the nervous system, and (3) the notochordal tube.</p>

  <p>The first is the present gut, the second the gut of the invertebrate ancestor, and the third
  the tube in question.</p>

  <p>These three unsegmented tubes, extending along the whole length <span class="pagenum"
  id="page440">{440}</span>of the segmented animal, constitute the great peculiarity of the
  vertebrate group; it is not the unsegmented notochord alone which requires explanation, but the
  presence of three such tubes in the same animal. Any one of them might be the unsegmented gut of
  the segmented animal. The most ventral tube is the actual gut of the present vertebrate; the most
  dorsal&mdash;the neural canal&mdash;was, according to my view, the original gut of the
  invertebrate ancestor; the middle one&mdash;the notochordal tube&mdash;was, in all probability,
  also once a gut, formed at the time when the exigencies of the situation made it difficult for
  food to pass along the original gut.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Yet another circumstance in favour of this suggestion is the very striking position of the
  anterior termination of the notochord. It terminates at the point of convergence of three
  structures<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(1) The tube of the hypophysis or nasal tube.</p>

  <p>(2) The infundibulum or old mouth-termination.</p>

  <p>(3) The notochordal tube.</p>

  <p>To these may be added, according to Kupffer, in the embryonic stage, the anterior diverticulum
  of the gut (Fig. <a href="#fig166">166</a>).</p>

  <p>This is a very significant point. Here originally, in the invertebrate stage, the olfactory
  passage opened into the old mouth and &#x0153;sophagus. Here, finally, in the completed vertebrate
  the same olfactory passage opens into the new pharynx. In the stage between the two it may well
  have opened into an intermediate gut, the notochordal tube, its separation from which would leave
  the end of the <span class="pagenum" id="page441">{441}</span>notochord blind, just as it had
  already left the end of the infundibulum blind.</p>

  <p>The whole evidence points to the derivation of the notochord from a ventral groove on the
  surface of the animal, which closed to form a tube capable of acting as an accessory gut at the
  critical period before the new gut was fully formed. The essentials of a gut tube are absorption
  and digestion of food; is it likely that a tube formed as I have suggested would be efficient for
  such purposes?</p>

  <p>As far as absorption is concerned, no difficulty would arise. The gut of the arthropod is lined
  with a thin layer of chitin, which is traversed, like all other chitinous surfaces, by fine
  canaliculi. Through these canaliculi, absorption of fluid material takes place, from the gut to
  the body. Similar canaliculi occur in the chitin covering the animal externally, so that, if such
  external surface formed a tube, and food in the right condition for absorption passed along it,
  absorption could easily take place through the chitinous surface. The evidence of Apus proves that
  food does pass along such a tube in the open condition, and in the trilobites the chitinous
  surface lining a similar groove was apparently very thin, a condition still more favourable to
  such an absorption process.</p>

  <p>At first sight the second essential of a gut-tube&mdash;the power of digestion&mdash;appears to
  present an insuperable difficulty to this method of forming an accessory gut-tube, for it
  necessitates the formation of a secretion capable of digesting proteid material by the external
  cells of the body, whereas until recently it was supposed that such a function was confined to
  cells belonging to the so-called hypoblastic layer. Experiments were made now years ago of turning
  a Hydra inside out so that its internal layer should become external, and <i>vice vers√¢</i>, and
  they were said to have been successful. Such an animal could go on living and absorbing and
  digesting food, although its epiblastic surface was now its digestive internal surface. More
  recent observations have shown that these experiments were fallacious. At night-time, when the
  observer was not looking, the hydra reinverted itself, so that again its original digestive
  surface was inside and it lived and prospered as before.</p>

  <p>Another piece of evidence of somewhat similar kind, which has not as yet been discredited, is
  seen in the Tunicata. In many of these, new individuals are formed from the parent by a process of
  budding, and it has been proved that frequently the gut of the new <span class="pagenum"
  id="page442">{442}</span>individual thus budded off arises not from the gut or hypoblastic layer
  of the parent, but from the surface or epiblastic layer. Such gut so formed possesses as efficient
  digestive powers as the gut of the parent.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable evidence of all has been afforded by Miss Alcock's experiments. She
  examined the different tissues of Ammoc&#x0153;tes for the express purpose of finding out their
  power of digesting fibrin, with the result that the most active cells were those of the liver.
  Next in activity came the extract of the lining cells of the respiratory chamber and of the skin.
  The intestine itself when freed from the liver-secretion had very little digestive power; extracts
  of muscle, nervous system, and thyroid gland had no power whatever, but the extract of the
  skin-cells possessed a powerful digesting action.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it is not necessary to make an extract of the skin in order to obtain this
  digestive fluid, for under the influence of chloroform the skin of Ammoc&#x0153;tes secretes
  copiously, and this fluid thus secreted was found to possess strong digestive powers. So, also,
  Miss Alcock has demonstrated the power of digesting fibrin in a similar secretion of the
  epithelial cells lining the carapace of the crayfish. In both cases a very plausible reason for
  the presence of a digestive ferment in a skin-secretion is found in the necessity of preventing
  the growth of parasites, fungoid, or otherwise, especially in those parts where the animal cannot
  keep itself clean by 'preening.' Thus in a crayfish, in which the &#x0153;sophageal commissures
  had been cut, fungus was found to grow on the ventral side, but not on the dorsal carapace. The
  animal was accustomed to keep its ventral surface clean by preening; owing to the paralysis it
  could not do so, and consequently the fungus grew there. In the lamprey I found that wherever
  there was a removal of the surface-epithelium, from whatever cause, that spot was immediately
  covered with a fungoid growth, although in the intact lamprey the skin was invariably smooth and
  clean.</p>

  <p>I imagine, then, that this digestive power of the skin arose as a protective mechanism against
  parasitic attacks; it is self-evident how a tube formed of such material must <i>ab initio</i> act
  as a digestive tube.</p>

  <p>In yet another respect this skin secretion of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is most instructive. The surface
  of Ammoc&#x0153;tes is absolutely smooth, no scales <span class="pagenum"
  id="page443">{443}</span>of any kind exist; this smoothness is due to the presence of a very
  well-defined cuticular layer secreted by the underlying epithelial cells. This cuticle is very
  much thicker than is usually found in vertebrates, and, strangely enough, has been thought to
  contain chitin. Whether it really contains chitin or not I am unable to say, but it certainly
  resembles a chitinous layer in one respect; it is perforated by innumerable very fine tubes or
  canaliculi, along which, by appropriate staining, it is easy to see the secretion of the
  underlying cell pass to the exterior (Fig. <a href="#fig140">140</a>). This marked digestive power
  of the skin of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, together with the easy passage of the secretion through the thin
  cuticular layer, renders it almost certain that a tube formed from the deep ventral groove of the
  trilobite would, from the very first, act as a digestive as well as an absorbent tube; in other
  words, the notochord as soon as formed was able to act as an accessory digestive tube.</p>

  <p>This suggested origin of the notochord from a groove along the mid-ventral surface of the body
  not only indicates a starting-point from a markedly segmented portion of the body, but also points
  to its formation at a stage previous to the formation of the operculum by the fusion of the two
  foremost mesosomatic appendages&mdash;indicates therefore its formation at a stage more nearly
  allied to the trilobite than to the sea-scorpion. The chance of ever finding any direct evidence
  of such a chordate trilobite stage appears to me exceedingly improbable, and I greatly fear that
  this conception of the mode of formation of the notochord can never be put to direct proof, but
  must always remain guesswork.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, evidence of a kind in favour of its origin from a segmented part of the body
  does exist, and that evidence has this special value, that it is found only in that most primitive
  animal, Amphioxus.</p>

  <p>This evidence is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="sp3">At fairly regular intervals, the sheath of the notochord is interrupted on each
  side of the mid-dorsal line by a series of holes, which penetrate the whole thickness of the
  sheath. This dorsal part is pressed closely against the spinal cord, and through these holes
  fibres appear to pass from the spinal cord to the interior of the notochord. So greatly do these
  fibres present the appearance of ventral roots to the notochord, that Miss Platt looks upon them
  as paired motor roots to the notochord, or at all events as once having been such motor <span
  class="pagenum" id="page444">{444}</span>roots. Lwoff and Rolph both describe a direct
  communication between the spinal cord and the notochord by means of fibres passing through these
  holes, without however looking upon this connection as a nervous one. Joseph alone asserts that no
  absolute connection exists, for the internal elastic layer of the notochord, according to him, is
  not interrupted at these holes, and forms, therefore, a barrier between the fibres from the spinal
  cord and those from the interior of the notochord. Still, whatever is the ultimate verdict as to
  these fibres, the suggestive fact remains of the spaces in the notochordal sheath and of the
  corresponding projecting root-like fibres from the spinal cord. The whole appearance gives the
  impression of some former connection, or rather series of connections, between the spinal cord and
  the notochord, such as would have occurred if nerves had once passed into the notochord. On the
  other hand, such nerves were not arranged segmentally with the myotomes, for, according to Joseph,
  in the middle of the animal ten to twelve such holes occur in one body-segment. In Apus the
  appendages are more numerous than the body-segments, so that it is not necessary for a segmental
  arrangement to coincide with that of the body-segments.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Origin of the Alimentary Canal.</span></p>

  <p>In close connection with the notochord is the alimentary canal. Any explanation of the one must
  be of assistance in explaining the other.</p>

  <p>According to the prevalent embryological teaching, the body is formed of three layers,
  epiblast, hypoblast, and mesoblast, and the gastr√¶a theory of the origin of all Metazoa implies of
  necessity that the formation of every individual commences with the formation of the gut. For this
  reason the alimentary canal must in every case be regarded as the earliest formed organ, however
  late in the development it may attain its finished appearance. Hence the notochord is spoken of as
  developed from the mid-dorsal wall of the alimentary canal. It is possible to look at the question
  the other way round, and suppose that the organ whose development is finished first is older than
  the one still in process of making. In this case it would be more right to say a ventral extension
  of the tissue, which gives rise to the notochord, takes place and forms the alimentary canal. It
  is, to my mind, perfectly possible, and indeed probable, that <span class="pagenum"
  id="page445">{445}</span>the formation of the vertebrate alimentary canal was a repetition of the
  same process which had already led to the formation of the notochordal tube. The formation of the
  anterior part of the alimentary canal in Ammoc&#x0153;tes at the time of transformation strongly
  suggests the marked similarity of the two processes.</p>

  <p>Of all the startling surprises which occur at transformation, this formation of a new anterior
  gut is the most startling. From the oral chamber of Petromyzon two tubes start: the one leads into
  the gill-chambers, is known as the bronchus, and is entirely concerned with respiration; the other
  leads without a break from the mouth to the anus, has no connection with respiration, and is the
  alimentary canal of the animal. Any one looking at Petromyzon would say that its alimentary canal
  was absolutely non-respiratory in character. Before transformation, this kind of alimentary canal
  commences at the end of the respiratory chamber; from here to the anus it is of the same character
  as in Petromyzon, but in Ammoc&#x0153;tes the non-respiratory anterior part simply does not exist:
  the whole anterior chamber is both respiratory and affords passage to food. This part of the
  alimentary canal of the adult is formed anew. We see, then, here the formation of a part of the
  alimentary canal taking place, not in an embryo full of yolk, but in a free-living, independent,
  grown-up larval form in which all yolk has long since disappeared: a condition absolutely unique
  in the vertebrate kingdom, but one which more than any other may be expected to give a clue to the
  method of formation of a vertebrate gut.</p>

  <p>The formation of this new gut can be easily followed at transformation, and was originally
  described by Schneider. His statement has been confirmed by Nestler, and its absolute truth has
  been demonstrated to me again and again by Miss Alcock, in her specimens illustrative of the
  transformation process. First, in the mid-dorsal line of the respiratory chamber a distinct groove
  is formed, the edges of which come together and form a solid rod. This solid rod blocks the
  opening of the respiratory chamber into the mid-gut, so that during this period of the
  transformation no food can pass out of the pharyngeal chamber. A lumen then begins to appear in
  this solid rod at the posterior end, which steadily advances mouthwards until it opens into the
  oral chamber and thus forms an open tube connecting the mouth with the gut.</p>

  <p>Here, then, is the foundation of a new gut on very similar lines <span class="pagenum"
  id="page446">{446}</span>to that of the notochord, by the conversion of a groove into a tube.
  Still more suggestive is it to find that the tube so formed has no appearance whatever of
  segmentation; it is as unsegmented as the rest of the gut, although, as is seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig62">62</a>, the dorsal wall of the respiratory chamber from which it arose is as
  markedly segmented as any part of the animal. Here under our very eyes, in the course of a few
  days or weeks, an object-lesson in the process of the manufacture of an alimentary canal is
  carried out and completed, and the teaching of that lesson is that a gut-tube may be formed in the
  same way as the notochordal tube, by the conversion of a grooved surface into a canal, and that
  gut-tube so formed, like the notochord, loses all sign of segmentation, even although the original
  grooved surface was markedly segmented.</p>

  <p>The suggestion then is, that the new gut may have been formed by a repetition of the same
  process which had already given origin to the notochord.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Such a method of formation is not, in my opinion, opposed to the evidence given by
  embryology, but in accordance with it; the discussion of this point will come best in the next
  chapter, which treats of the embryological evidence as a whole, and will therefore be left till
  then.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Evidence given by the Innervation of the Vertebrate Alimentary
  Canal.</span></p>

  <p>Throughout this investigation the one fixed landmark to which all other comparisons must be
  referred, is the central nervous system, and the innervation of every organ has given the clue to
  the meaning of that organ. So also it must be with the new alimentary canal; by its innervation we
  ought to obtain some insight into the manner of its origination. In any organ the nerves which are
  specially of value in determining its innervation, are of necessity the efferent or motor nerves,
  for the limits of their distribution in the organ are much more easily determined than those of
  the afferent or sensory nerves. The question therefore of primary importance in endeavouring to
  determine the nature of the origin of the alimentary canal from its innervation is the
  determination of the efferent supply to the musculature of its walls.</p>

  <p>Already in previous chapters a commencement has been made in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page447">{447}</span>this direction; thus the musculature of the oral chamber has been derived
  directly from the musculature of the prosomatic appendages; the muscles which move the eyes from
  the prosomatic and mesosomatic dorso-ventral somatic muscles; the longitudinal body-muscles from
  the dorsal longitudinal somatic muscles of the arthropod; the muscles of respiration from the
  dorso-ventral muscles of the mesosomatic appendages.</p>

  <p>In all these cases we have been dealing with striated musculature and consequently with only
  the motor nerves of the muscle; but the gut posterior to the pharyngeal or respiratory chamber
  contains unstriped instead of striped muscle, and is innervated by two sets of nerves, those which
  cause contraction and are motor, and those which cause relaxation and are inhibitory. It is by no
  means certain that these two sets of nerves possess equal value from a morphological point of
  view. The meaning of an inhibitory nerve is at present difficult to understand, and in this
  instance, is rendered still more doubtful owing to the presence of Auerbach's plexus along the
  whole length of the intestine&mdash;an elaborate system of nerve-cells and nerve-fibres situated
  between the layers of longitudinal and circular muscles surrounding the gut-walls, which has been
  shown by the recent experiments of Magnus, to constitute a special enteric nervous system.</p>

  <p>One of the strangest facts known about the system of inhibitory nerves is their marked tendency
  to leave the central nervous system at a different level to the corresponding motor nerves, as is
  well known in the case of the heart, where the inhibitory nerve&mdash;the vagus&mdash;arises from
  the medulla oblongata, while the motor nerve&mdash;the augmentor or accelerator&mdash;leaves the
  spinal cord in the upper thoracic region. It is very difficult to obtain any idea of the origin of
  such a peculiarity; I know of only one suggestive fact, which concerns the innervation of the
  muscles which open and close the chela of the crayfish, lobster, etc. These muscles are
  antagonistic to each other, and both possess inhibitory as well as motor nerves. The central
  nervous system arrangements are of such a character that the contraction of the one muscle is
  accompanied by the inhibition of its opposer, and the nerves which inhibit the contraction of the
  one, leave the central nervous system with the nerves which cause the other to contract. Thus the
  inhibitory and motor nerves of either the abductor (opener) or adductor (closer) muscles of the
  crayfish claw do not leave the central nervous system together, but in separate nerves.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page448">{448}</span></div>

  <p>If now for some cause the one set of muscles either disappeared, or were so altered as no
  longer to present any appearance of antagonism, then there would be left a single set of muscles,
  the inhibitory and motor nerves of which would leave the central nervous system at different
  levels, and the older such systems might be, the greater would be the modification in the shape
  and arrangements of parts in the animal, so that the two sets of fibres might ultimately arise
  from very different levels.</p>

  <p>As mentioned in the introductory chapter, the whole of this investigation into the origin of
  vertebrates arose from my work on the system of efferent nerves which innervate the vascular and
  visceral systems. One of the main points of that investigation was the proof that such nerves did
  not leave the central nervous system uniformly along the whole length of it, but in three great
  outflows, cranial, thoracico-lumbar, and sacral; there being two marked gaps separating the three
  outflows, caused by the interpolation of the plexuses for the innervation of the anterior and
  posterior limbs respectively. All these nerves are characterized by the presence of ganglion-cells
  in their course to the periphery, they are, therefore, distinguished from ordinary motor nerves to
  striated muscle in that their impulses pass through a ganglion-cell before they reach the
  muscle.</p>

  <p>The ganglia of the large middle thoracico-lumbar outflow constitute the ganglia of the
  sympathetic system.</p>

  <p>The functions of the nerves constituting these three outflows are very different, as I pointed
  out in my original papers. Since then a large amount of further information has been obtained by
  various observers, especially Langley and Anderson, which enable the following statements to be
  made<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>All the nerves which cause contraction of the unstriped muscles of the skin, whether pilomotor
  or not, all the nerves which cause secretion of sweat glands wherever situated, all the nerves
  which cause contraction or augmentation of the action of muscles belonging to the vascular system,
  all the nerves which are motor to the muscles belonging to all organs derived from the Wolffian
  and M√ºllerian ducts, <i>e.g.</i> the uterus, ureters, urethra, arise from the thoracico-lumbar
  outflow, never from the cranial or sacral outflows. It is essentially an efferent skin-system.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the latter two sets of nerves are concerned <span class="pagenum"
  id="page449">{449}</span>with the supply of motor nerves to the alimentary canal; they form
  essentially an efferent gut-system in contradistinction to the sympathetic or skin-system.</p>

  <p>A marked distinction exists between these cranial and sacral nerves. The vagus never supplies
  the large intestine, the sacral nerves never supply the small intestine. Associated with the large
  intestine is the bladder, the whole system arising from the original cloacal region; the vagus
  never supplies the bladder, its motor nerves belong to the sacral outflow. The motor nerves to the
  ureters, to the urethra, and to the trigonal portion of the bladder between the ureters and the
  urethra, do not arise from the sacral outflow, but from the thoracico-lumbar. These muscles belong
  really to the muscles in connection with the M√ºllerian and Wolffian ducts and skin, not to the
  cloacal region.</p>

  <p>The motor innervation then of the alimentary canal reveals this striking and suggestive state
  of affairs. The motor innervation of the whole of the small intestine arises from the cranial
  region, and is immediately followed by an innervation from the sacral region for the whole of the
  muscles of the cloaca. It thus indicates a head-region and a tail-region in close contiguity, the
  whole of the spinal cord region between these two extremes being apparently unrepresented. Not,
  however, quite unrepresented, for Elliott has shown recently that the ileo-colic valve at the
  junction of the small and large intestine is in reality an ileo-colic sphincter muscle, and that
  this muscle receives its motor nerves neither from the vagus nor from the sacral nerves, but from
  the thoracico-lumbar outflow or sympathetic system. This may mean one of two things, either that a
  band of fibres belonging to the skin-system has been added to the gut-musculature, for the purpose
  of forming a sphincter at this spot, or that the region between the vagus territory and the cloaca
  is represented by this small band of muscle. The second explanation seems to me the more probable
  of the two. Between the mesosomatic region represented by the vagus, and the cloacal region, there
  existed a small metasomatic region, represented by the pronephros, with its segmental duct, as
  already discussed in Chapter XII. That part of the new alimentary canal which belonged to this
  region is the short piece indicated by the ileo-colic sphincter, and innervated, therefore, from
  the same region as the organs derived from the segmental duct.</p>

  <p>Such innervation seems to me to suggest that originally the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page450">{450}</span>vertebrate consisted, as far as its gut was concerned, of a prosomatic
  and mesosomatic (branchial) region, close behind which came the cloaca and anus. Between the two
  there was a short metasomatic region (possibly pronephric), so that the respiratory chamber did
  not open directly into the cloaca.</p>

  <p>Such an interpretation is, I think, borne out by the study of the most ancient forms of fish.
  In Bothriolepis, according to Patten, and in Drepanaspis, according to Traquair, the cloacal
  region and anus follow immediately upon the posterior end of the head-shield, <i>i.e.</i>
  immediately after that region which presumably contained the branchi√¶. Similarly, on the
  invertebrate side, all those forms which resembled Limulus must have possessed a very short region
  between the branchial and cloacal parts of the body. The original cloacal part of the vertebrate
  gut may well have been the original cloaca of the arthropod, into which its intestine emptied
  itself, especially when we see the tendency of the scorpion group of animals to form an accessory
  cloacal pouch known as the stercoral pouch or pocket.</p>

  <p>Again, it is striking to see how, in certain of the scorpion group, <i>e.g.</i> Thelyphonus and
  Phrynus, there is a caudal massing of the central nerve-cells as well as a cephalic massing, so
  that their central nervous system is composed of a cephalic and caudal brain. These two brains are
  connected together by commissures extending the whole length of the body, in which I have been
  unable to find any sign of ganglion-cells. What this caudal brain innervates I do not know; it is,
  I think, a matter worth further investigation, especially as there are many indications in the
  vertebrate that the lumbo-sacral region of the cord possesses higher functions than the thoracic
  region.</p>

  <p>The method of formation of the alimentary canal as indicated by its innervation is as
  follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>In front an oral chamber, formed, as already pointed out, by the modification of the prosomatic
  appendages, followed by a respiratory chamber, the muscles and branchi√¶ of which were the muscles
  and branchi√¶ of the mesosomatic appendages. This mesosomatic, or branchial, part was in close
  contiguity to the cloaca and anus, being separated from it only by a short tube formed in the
  metasomatic or pronephric region.</p>

  <p>I imagine that this connection was originally in the form of an <span class="pagenum"
  id="page451">{451}</span>open groove, as already explained for both notochord and the anterior
  part of the gut itself in Ammoc&#x0153;tes; an open groove formed from the mid-ventral surface of
  the body, on each side of which were the remnants of the pronephric appendages. By the closure of
  this groove ventrally, and the growing round of the pleural folds, as already suggested, the
  remains of the pronephric appendages are indicated by the segmental duct and the form of the
  vertebrate body is attained.</p>

  <p>Even in the branchial region the same kind of thing must, I think, have occurred. The grooved
  ventral surface became a tube, on each side of which were lying in regular order the in-sunk
  branchial appendages, the whole being subsequently covered by the pleural folds to form an atrial
  chamber. A tube thus formed from the grooved ventral surface would carry with it to the new
  ventral surface the longitudinal venous sinuses, and thus form, in the way already suggested, the
  heart and ventral aorta. Posterior to the heart in the pronephric region, the same process would
  give rise to the sub-intestinal vein.</p>

  <p>The evidence of comparative anatomy bears out most conclusively the suggestion that in the
  original vertebrate the gut was mainly a respiratory chamber. In man and all mammals the oral
  chamber opens into a small pharynx, followed by the &#x0153;sophagus, stomach and small intestine.
  Of this whole length, a very small part is taken up by the pharynx, in which, in the embryo, the
  branchial arches are found, showing that this represents the original respiratory part of the gut.
  In the ordinary fish this branchial part is much more conspicuous, occupies a large proportion of
  the gut, and in the lowest fishes, such as Ammoc&#x0153;tes and Amphioxus, the branchial region
  extends over a large portion of the animal, while the intestine proper is a straight tube, the
  length of which is insignificant in comparison with its length in the higher vertebrates.</p>

  <p>Such a tube was able to act as a digestive tube, owing, as already pointed out, to the
  digestive powers of the skin-epithelium, and I imagine at first the respiratory chamber, seeing
  that it composed very nearly the whole of the gut, was at the same time the main digestive
  chamber; even in Ammoc&#x0153;tes its digestive power is superior to that of the intestine
  itself.</p>

  <p>Just posterior to the branchial part a diverticulum of the gut was formed at an early stage, as
  seen in Amphioxus, and provided the <span class="pagenum" id="page452">{452}</span>commencement of
  the liver. This simple liver-diverticulum became the tubular liver of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and
  formed, curiously enough, not a glandular organ of the same character as the liver of the higher
  vertebrates, but a hepato-pancreas, like the so-called liver of the arthropods, which also is a
  special diverticulum of the gut, or rather the main true gut of the animal. In both cases the
  liver is the chief agent in digestion, for in Ammoc&#x0153;tes the liver-extract is very much more
  powerful in the digestion of proteids than the extract of any other organ tried by Miss Alcock.
  Subsequently in the vertebrate the gastric and pancreatic glands arise and relieve the liver of
  the burden of proteid digestion.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is, to my mind, somewhat significant that the liver on its first formation in
  the vertebrate should have arisen as a digestive organ of the same character as the so-called
  liver in the arthropods; whether it originally belonged to any separate segment is in our present
  state of knowledge difficult to say.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Conclusion.</span></p>

  <p>In conclusion, I will endeavour to illustrate crudely the way in which, on my theory, the
  notochord and vertebrate gut may have been formed, the agencies at work being in the main two,
  viz. the dwindling of appendages as mere organs of locomotion, and the conversion of a ventral
  groove into a tube.</p>

  <p>I imagine that, among the Protostraca, forms were found somewhat resembling trilobites with
  markedly polych√¶tan affinities; which, like Apus, possessed a deep ventral groove from one end of
  the body to the other, and also pleural fringes, as in many trilobites. This might be called the
  Trilobite stage (Fig. <a href="#fig167">167</a>, A).</p>

  <p>This groove became converted into a tube and so gave rise to the notochord, while the
  appendages were still free and the pleur√¶ had not met to form a new ventral surface. This might be
  called the Chordate Trilobite stage (Fig. <a href="#fig167">167</a>, B).</p>

  <p>Then, passing from the protostracan to the pal√¶ostracan stage, the oral and respiratory
  chambers were formed, not communicating with each other, in the manner described in previous
  chapters, a ventral groove in the metasomatic region being the only connection between respiratory
  chamber and cloaca. This might be called the Chordate Pal√¶ostracan stage (Fig. <a
  href="#fig167">167</a>, C).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page454">{454}</span></div>

  <p>Finally, with the conversion of this groove into a tube, the opening of the oral into the
  respiratory chamber, and the formation of an atrium by the ventralwards growth of the pleural
  folds, the formation of a Vertebrate was completed (Fig. <a href="#fig167">167</a>, D).</p>

  <p>In my own mind I picture to myself an animal which possessed eurypterid and trilobite
  characters combined, in which a notochordal tube had been formed in the way suggested, and a
  respiratory chamber which communicated with the cloaca by means of a grooved channel along the
  mid-ventral line of the metasomatic portion of the body. On each side of this channel were the
  remains of the metasomatic appendages (pronephric). The whole was enveloped in the pleural folds,
  which probably at this time did not yet meet in the middle line to form a new ventral surface.
  This respiratory chamber, owing to the digestive power of the epidermis, assisted in the process
  of alimentation to such an extent as to supersede the temporary notochordal tube, with the effect
  of bringing about the conversion of the metasomatic groove into a closed canal, and so the
  formation of an alimentary tube continuous with the respiratory chamber. The amalgamation of the
  pleural folds ventrally completed the process, and so formed an animal resembling the
  Cephalaspid√¶, Ammoc&#x0153;tes, or Amphioxus.</p>

  <p class="sp5">I have endeavoured in this chapter to make some suggestions upon the origin of the
  notochord and of the vertebrate gut in accordance with my theory of the origin of vertebrates. I
  feel, however, strongly that these suggestions are much more speculative than those put forward in
  the previous chapters, and of necessity cannot give the same feeling of soundness as those based
  directly upon comparative anatomy and histology. Still, the fact remains that the origin of the
  notochord is at present absolutely unknown, and that my speculation that it may have originated as
  an accessory digestive tube is at all events in accordance with the most widely spread opinion
  that it arises in close connection with an alimentary canal.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In a discussion upon this theory of mine, which took place at Cambridge on November 25 and
  December 2, 1895, it was said that such a theory was absolutely and definitely put out of court,
  because it contravened the principles of embryology, was opposed, therefore, to our surest guide
  in such matters; and the law was laid down with great assurance that no claim for genetic
  relationship between two groups of animals can be allowed which is based upon topographical and
  structural coincidences revealed by the study of the anatomy of two adult animals, however
  numerous and striking they may be, if there are fundamental differences in the embryology of the
  members of these two groups.</p>

  <p>According to my theory the old gut of the arthropod still exists in the vertebrate as the
  tubular lining of the central nervous system, and the vertebrate has formed a new gut. According
  to the principles of embryology as held up to the present, in all animals above the Protozoa, the
  different structures of the body arise from three definite embryonic layers, the epiblast,
  mesoblast, and hypoblast, and in all cases the gut arises from the hypoblastic layer. In the
  vertebrate the gut also arises from the hypoblast, while the neural canal is epiblastic. My
  theory, then, makes the impossible assertion that what was hypoblast in the arthropod has become
  epiblast in the vertebrate, and what was epiblast in the arthropod has become hypoblast in the
  vertebrate. Such a conception is supposed to be so <span class="pagenum"
  id="page456">{456}</span>absolutely impossible that it only requires to be stated to be dismissed
  as an absurdity.</p>

  <p>Against this opinion I claim boldly that my theory is not only not contrary to the principles
  of embryology, but is mainly based upon the teachings of embryology. I wish here not to be
  misunderstood. The great value of the study of embryology for questions of the sequence of the
  evolution of animals is to be found in what is known as the Law of Recapitulation, which asserts
  that every animal gives some indication in the stages of its individual development of its
  ancestral history. Naturally enough it cannot pass through all the stages of its past history with
  equal clearness, for what has taken millions of years to be evolved has to be compressed into an
  evolution lasting only a few months or weeks, or even less.</p>

  <p>When in the highest vertebrate a vestigial organ, such as the pineal gland, can be traced back
  without leaving the vertebrate kingdom to a distinct median eye, such as is found in the lamprey,
  that rudimentary organ is evidence of an organ which was functional in the earliest vertebrates or
  their immediate ancestors. So it is generally with well defined vestigial organs found in the
  adult animal; they always indicate an organ which was functional in the near ancestor.</p>

  <p>Passing from the adult to the embryo we still find the same law. Here, also, vestigial organs
  are met with, which may leave no trace in the adult, but indicate organs which were functional in
  the near ancestor. Thus, but for embryology, we should have no certainty that the air-breathing
  vertebrates had been derived from water-breathing fishes; the indication is not given by any close
  resemblance between the formation of the embryos in their earliest stages, but by the formation of
  vestigial gill-arches even in the embryos of the highest mammal.</p>

  <p>For all questions of evolution the presence of vestigial organs in the embryo is the important
  consideration, for they give an indication of near ancestry; the early formation of the embryo
  concerns a much more remote ancestral period, all vestigial organs of which may well have been
  lost and obscured by c&#x0153;nogenetic changes. Let us, then, consider the two things&mdash;the
  vestigial organs and the early formation of the embryo&mdash;separately, and see how far my
  opponents are justified in their statement that my theory contravenes the principles of
  embryology.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page457">{457}</span></div>

  <p>First, I will take the teachings of vestigial organs and the arrangement of organs found in the
  vertebrate embryo. Here it is impossible to say that my theory is contrary to the teaching of
  embryology, for as the previous chapters have shown again and again, the argument is based very
  largely upon the facts of embryology. In the first place, the comparison which I have chiefly made
  is a comparison between the larval form of a very low vertebrate and the arthropod group, a
  comparison which exists only for the larval form, and not for the adult. The whole theory, then,
  is based upon a developmental stage of the vertebrate, and not upon the anatomy of the adult.</p>

  <p>Throughout the whole history it seems to me perfectly marvellous how completely the law of
  recapitulation is vindicated by my theory of the origin of the vertebrate. The theory asserts that
  the clue to the origin of vertebrates is to be found in the tubular nature of the central nervous
  system of the vertebrate; in that the vertebrate central nervous system is in reality formed of
  two things: (1) a central nervous system of the arthropod type, and (2) an epithelial tube in the
  position of the alimentary canal of the arthropod.</p>

  <p>Is it possible for embryology to recapitulate such a phylogenetic history more clearly than is
  here the case? In order to avoid all possibility of our mistaking the clue, the nerve-tube in the
  embryo always opens into the anus at its posterior end, while in the larval Amphioxus it is
  actually still open to the exterior at the anterior end. The separateness of the tube from the
  nervous system at its first origin is shown especially well in the frog, where, as Assheton has
  pointed out, owing to the pigment in the cells of the external layer of epithelium, a pigmented
  tube is formed, on the outside of which the nervous tissue is lying, and step by step the gradual
  intermingling of the nerve-cells and the pigmented lining cells can be followed out.</p>

  <p>Consider the shape of the nerve-tube when first formed in the vertebrate. At the cephalic end a
  simple bulged-out tube with two simple anterior diverticula, which passes into a narrow straight
  spinal tube; from this large cephalic bulging a narrow diverticulum, the infundibulum, passes to
  the ventral surface of the forming brain. This tube is the embryological expression of the simple
  dilated cephalic stomach, with its ventral &#x0153;sophagus and two anterior diverticula, which
  opens into the straight intestine of the arthropod. Nay, more, by its very shape, and the
  invariable presence of two anterior <span class="pagenum" id="page458">{458}</span>diverticula, it
  points not only to an arthropod ancestry, but to a descent from a particular group of primitive
  arthropods. Then comes the formation of the cerebral vesicles, and the formation of the optic cup,
  telling us as plainly as can be how the invasion of nervous material over this simple cephalic
  stomach and its diverticula has altered the shape of the original tube, and more and more enclosed
  it with nervous elements.</p>

  <p>So, too, in the spinal cord region. When the tube is first formed, it is a large tube, the
  latero-ventral part of which presents two marked bulgings; connecting these two bulgings is the
  anterior commissure. These two lateral bulgings, with their transverse commissure, represent, with
  marked fidelity, the ventral ganglion-masses of the arthropod with their transverse commissure,
  and occupy the same position with respect to the spinal tube, as the ganglion-masses do with
  respect to the intestine in the arthropod. Then the further development shows how, by the
  subsequent growth of the nervous material, the calibre of the tube is diminished in size, and the
  spinal cord is formed.</p>

  <p>Again, I say, is it possible to conceive that embryology should indicate the nature of the
  origin of the vertebrate nervous system more clearly than it does?</p>

  <p>It is the same with all the other organs. Take, for instance, the skeletal tissues. The study
  of the vertebrate embryo asserts that the cartilaginous skeleton arose as simple branchial bars
  and a simple cranio-facial skeleton, and also that the parenchymatous variety of cartilage
  represents the embryonic form. Word for word, the early embryonic stage of the vertebrate skeleton
  closely resembles the stage reached in the arthropod, as shown by Limulus, and again records,
  unmistakably, the past history of the vertebrate.</p>

  <p>So, too, with the whole of the prosomatic region; the situation of the old mouth, the manner in
  which the nose of the cephalaspidian fishes arose from the pal√¶ostracan, are all shown with vivid
  clearness by Kupffer's investigations of the early stage of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, while at the same
  time the closure of the oral cavity by the septum shows how the oral chamber was originally
  bounded by the operculum. Nay, further, the very formation of this chamber embryologically was
  brought about by the forward growth of the lower lip, just as it must have been if the chilaria
  grew forward to form the metastoma.</p>

  <p>So, too, the study of the embryo teaches that the branchi√¶ arise as <span class="pagenum"
  id="page459">{459}</span>ingrowths, that the heart arises as two longitudinal veins, just as the
  theory supposes from the facts provided by Limulus and the scorpions. No indication of the origin
  of the thyroid gland is given by the study of its structure in any adult vertebrate, but in the
  larval form of the lamprey there is still preserved for us a most graphic record of its past
  history.</p>

  <p>The close comparisons which it is possible to make between the eye-muscles of the vertebrate
  and the recti muscles of the scorpion group on the one hand, and between the pituitary and coxal
  glands on the other, are based upon, or at all events are strikingly confirmed by, the study of
  the c&#x0153;lomic cavities and the origin of these muscles in the two groups. In fact the
  embryological evidence of the double segmentation in the head and the whole nature of the cranial
  segments is one of the main foundation-stones on which the whole of my theory rests.</p>

  <p>So it is throughout. Turn to the excretory organs&mdash;it is not the kidney of the adult
  animal which leads direct to the excretory organs of the primitive arthropod, but the early
  embryonic origin of that kidney.</p>

  <p>So far from having put forward a theory which runs counter to the principles of embryology, I
  claim to have vindicated the great Law of Recapitulation which is the foundation-stone of
  embryological principles. My theory is largely based upon embryological facts, and its strength
  consists in the manner in which it links together into one harmonious whole, the facts of
  Embryology, Pal√¶ontology, Anatomy, and Physiology. Why, then, is it possible to assert that my
  theory disregards the principles of embryology, when, as we have seen, embryology is proclaiming
  as loudly as possible how the vertebrate arose? In my opinion, it is because the embryologists
  have to a large extent gone wrong in their fundamental principles, and have attached more weight
  to these faulty fundamental principles than to the obvious facts which, looked at thoughtfully,
  could not have failed to suggest a doubt as to the correctness of these 'principles.'</p>

  <p>The current laws of embryology upon which such weight is laid are based on the homology of the
  germinal layers in all Metazoa, and state that in all cases after segmentation is finished a
  blastula is formed, from which there arises a gastrula, formed of an internal layer, the
  hypoblast, and an external layer, the epiblast; subsequently <span class="pagenum"
  id="page460">{460}</span>between these arises a third layer, the mesoblast. These layers are
  strictly morphological conceptions, and are stated to be homologous in all cases, so that the
  hypoblast of one animal must be homologous to the hypoblast of another. In order, therefore, to
  compare two adult animals for the purpose of finding kinship between them, it is necessary to find
  whether parts such as the gut, which in both cases have the same function, arise from the same
  germinal layer in the embryo. We can, in fact, have no certainty of kinship, even although the two
  animals are built up as far as the adult state is concerned on a remarkably similar plan, unless
  we can study their respective embryos and find out what parts arise from the hypoblast and what
  from the epiblast. The homology of the germinal layers constitutes in all cases of disputed
  relationship the court of final appeal. A new gut, therefore, in any animal can only be formed
  from hypoblast, and any theory, such as that advocated in this book, which deals with the
  formation of a new gut, and does not form that gut from pre-existing hypoblast, must of necessity
  be wrong and needs no further consideration.</p>

  <p>Such is the result of current conceptions&mdash;conceptions which to be valid must be based
  upon an absolutely clear morphological definition of the formation of the germinal layers, a
  definition not based on their subsequent history and function, but determined solely by the
  uniformity of the manner of their origin.</p>

  <p>What, then, is a germinal layer? How can we identify it when it first arises? What is the
  morphological criterion by which hypoblast can be distinguished from epiblast, or mesoblast from
  either?</p>

  <p>This is the question put by Braem, in an admirable series of articles in the <i>Biologisches
  Centralblatt</i>, and is one that must be answered by every worker who bases his views of the
  process of evolution upon embryological investigation. As Braem points out, the germinal layers
  are definable either from a morphological or physiological standpoint. In the one case they must
  arise throughout on the same plan, and whatever be their fate in the adult, they must form at an
  early stage structures strictly homologous in all animals. In the other case the criterion is
  based on function, and the hypoblast, for instance, is that layer which is found afterwards to
  form the definitive alimentary canal. There is no longer any morphological homology; such layers
  are analogous; they may be, but are not necessarily, homologous. Braem gives a sketch of the
  history of the views held on <span class="pagenum" id="page461">{461}</span>the germinal layers,
  and shows how they were originally a purely physiological conception, and how gradually such
  conception changed into a morphological one, with the result that what had up to that time been
  looked upon as analogous structures became strictly homologous and of fundamental importance in
  deciding the position of any animal in the whole animal series.</p>

  <p>This change of opinion was especially due to the lively imagination of Haeckel, who taught that
  the germinal layers of all Metazoa must be strictly homologous, because they were all derived from
  a common ancestral stock, represented by a hypothetical animal to which he gave the name Gastr√¶a;
  an animal which was formed by the simple invagination of a part of the blastula, thus giving rise
  to the original hypoblast and epiblast, and he taught that throughout the animal kingdom the
  germinal layers were formed by such an invagination of a part of the blastula to form a simple
  gastrula. If further investigation had borne out Haeckel's idea, if therefore the hypoblast was in
  all cases formed as the invagination of a part of a single-layered blastula, then indeed the dogma
  of the homology of the germinal layers would be on so firm a foundation that no speculation which
  ran counter to it could be expected to receive acceptance; but that is just what has not taken
  place. The formation of the gastrula by simple invagination of the single-layered blastula is the
  exception, not the rule, and, as pointed out by Braem, is significantly absent in the earliest
  Metazoa; in those very places where, on the Gastr√¶a theory, it ought to be most conspicuous.</p>

  <p>Braem discusses the question most ably, and shows again and again that in every case the true
  criterion upon which it is decided whether certain cells are hypoblastic or not is not
  morphological but physiological. The decision does not rest upon the answer to the question, Are
  these cells in reality the invaginated cells of a single-celled blastula? but to the question, Do
  these cells ultimately form the definitive alimentary canal? The decision is always based on the
  function of the cells, not on their morphological position. Not only in Braem's paper, but
  elsewhere, we see that in recent years the physiological criterion is becoming more and more
  accepted by morphologists. Thus Graham Kerr, in his paper on the development of Lepidosiren, says:
  "It seems to me quite impossible to define a layer as hypoblastic except by asking one or other of
  the two questions: (1) Does it form the lining of an archenteric cavity? and (2) <span
  class="pagenum" id="page462">{462}</span>Does it become a certain part of the definitive
  epithelial lining of the gut?"</p>

  <p>The appearance of Braem's paper was followed by a criticism from the pen of Samassa, who agrees
  largely with Braem, but thinks that he presses the physiological argument too far. He considers
  that morphological laws must exist for the individual development as well as for the phylogenetic,
  and finishes his article with the following sentence, a sentence in which it appears to me he
  expresses what is fast becoming the prevailing view: "Mit dem Satz, den man mitunter lesen kann:
  'es muss doch auch f√ºr die Ontogenie allgemeine Gesetze geben' kann leicht Missbrauch getrieben
  werden; diese allgemeinen Gesetze giebt es wohl, aber sie liegen nicht auf flacher Hand und bis zu
  ihrer Erkenntnis hat es noch gute Wege; das eine kann man aber wohl heute schon sagen, die
  Keimbl√§tterlehre geh√∂rt zu diesen allgemeinen Gesetzen nicht."</p>

  <p>I conclude, then, that we ought to go back to a time previous to that of Haeckel and ask
  ourselves seriously the question, When we lay stress on the germinal layers and speak of this or
  that organ arising from this or that germinal layer, are we thereby adding anything to the
  knowledge that we already possess from the study of the anatomy and physiology of the adult body?
  If by hypoblast we only mean the internal surface or alimentary canal and its glands, etc., and by
  epiblast we mean the external surface or skin and its glands, etc., while mesoblast indicates the
  middle structures between the other two, then I fail to see what advantages we obtain by using
  Greek terms to express in the embryo what we express in English in the adult.</p>

  <p>The evidence given by Braem, and it could be strengthened considerably, is conclusive against
  the morphological importance of the theory of the germinal layers, and transfers the fundamental
  importance of the early embryonic formation, from that of a three-layered embryo to that of a
  single-layered embryo&mdash;the blastula&mdash;from which, in various ways, the adult animal has
  arisen.</p>

  <p>The derivation of both arthropod and vertebrate from such a single-layered animal is perfectly
  conceivable, even though the gut of the latter is not homologous with the gut of the former. We
  have seen that the teachings of embryology, as far as its later stages are concerned, afford one
  of the main supports upon which this theory rests. What, therefore, is required to complete the
  story is the way <span class="pagenum" id="page463">{463}</span>in which these later stages arise
  from the blastula stage; here, as in all cases, the ontogenetic laws must be in harmony with the
  phylogenetic; of the latter the most important is the steady development of the central nervous
  system for the upward progress of the animal race. The study of comparative anatomy indicates the
  central nervous system, not the gut, as the keystone of the edifice. So, also, it must be with
  ontogeny; here also the central factor in the formation of the adult from the blastula ought to be
  the formation of the central nervous system, not that of the gut.</p>

  <p>Such, it appears to me, is the case, as may be seen from the following considerations.</p>

  <p>The study of the development of any animal can be treated in two ways: either we can trace back
  from the adult to the very beginning in the ovum, or we can trace forward from the fertilized egg
  to the adult. Both methods ought to lead to the same result; the difference is, that in the first
  case we are passing from the more known to the less known, and are expressing the unknown in terms
  of the known. In the second case we are passing from the less known to the more known, and are
  expressing the known in speculative terms, invented to explain the unknown. What has just been
  said with respect to the germinal layers means that, however much we may study the embryo and try
  to express the adult in terms of it, we finally come back to the first way of looking at the
  question, and, starting with the adult, trace the continuity of function back to the first
  formation of cells having a separate function.</p>

  <p>Let us, then, apply this throughout, and see what are the logical results of tracing back the
  various organs and tissues from the adult to the embryo.</p>

  <p>The adult body is built up of different kinds of tissues, which fall naturally, from the
  standpoint of physiology, into groups. Such groups are, in the first place&mdash;</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p>1. All those tissues which are connected with the central nervous system, including in that
    group the nervous system itself.</p>
    <p class="sp0">2. All those tissues which have no connection with the nervous system.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the second group the physiologist places all germinal cells, all blood- and
  lymph-corpuscles, all plasma-cells and connective tissue and its derivatives&mdash;in fact, all
  free-living cells, whether in a free state or in a quiescent, so to speak encysted, condition,
  such as is <span class="pagenum" id="page464">{464}</span>found in connective tissue. In the first
  group the physiologist recognizes that the central nervous system is connected with all muscular
  tissues, whether striped or unstriped, somatic or splanchnic, and that such connection is of an
  intimate character. Further, all epithelial cells, either of the outer or inner surfaces, whether
  forming special sense-organs and glands, such as the digestive and sweat-glands, or not, are
  connected with the nervous system. Besides these structures, there is another set of organs as to
  which we cannot speak definitely at present, which must be considered separately, viz. all the
  cells, together with their derived organs, which line the body-spaces. Whatever may be the
  ultimate decision as to this group of cells, it must fall into one or other of the two main
  groups.</p>

  <p>The members of these two groups are so interwoven with one another that either, if taken alone,
  would still give the form of the body, so that, in a certain sense, we can speak of the body as
  formed of two syncytia, separate from each other, but interlaced, of which the one forms a
  continuous whole by means of cells connected together by a fluid medium or by solid threads formed
  in such fluid medium, while the other does not form a syncytium in the sense that any cell of one
  kind may be connected with any cell of another kind, but a syncytium of which all the different
  elements are connected together only through the medium of the nervous system.</p>

  <p>If we choose to speak of the body as made up of two syncytia in this way, we must at the same
  time recognize the fundamental difference in character between them. In the one case the elements
  are connected together only by what may be called non-living material; there is no direct
  metabolic activity caused by the action of one cell over a more distant cell in consequence of
  such connection, it is not a true syncytium; in the second case there is a living connection, the
  metabolism of one part is directly influenced by the activity of another, and the whole utility of
  the system depends upon such functional connection.</p>

  <p>The tissues composing this second syncytium may be spoken of as the master-tissues of the body,
  and we may express this conception of the building up of the body of the higher Metazoa by saying
  that it is composed of a syncytial host formed of the master-tissues, which contains within its
  meshes a system of free-living cells, none of which have any connection with the nervous system.
  This syncytial <span class="pagenum" id="page465">{465}</span>host is in the adult composed of a
  number of double elements, a nerve-cell element, and an epithelial element, such as muscle-cell,
  gland-cell, etc., connected together by nerves; and if such connection is always present as we
  pass from the adult to the embryo, if there is no period when, for example, the neural element
  exists alone free from the muscle-cell, no period when the two can be seen to come together and
  join, then it follows that when the single-layered blastula stage is reached, muscle-cell and
  nerve-cell must have fused together to form a neuro-muscular cell. Similarly with all the other
  neuro-epithelial organs; however far apart their two components may be in the adult, they must
  come together and fuse in the embryo to form a neuro-epithelial element.</p>

  <p>The close connection between muscle and nerve which has always been recognized by
  physiologists, together with the origin of muscle from a myo-epithelial cell in Hydra and other
  C&#x0153;lenterata, led the older physiologists to accept thoroughly Hensen's views of the
  neuro-epithelial origin of all tissues connected with the central nervous system. Of late years
  this conception has been largely given up owing to the statement of His that the nervous system
  arises from a number of neuroblasts, which are entirely separate cells, and have at first no
  connection with muscle-cells or any peripheral epithelial cells, but subsequently, by the
  outgrowing of an axial fibre, find their way to the muscle, etc., and connect with it. I do not
  think that His' statement by itself would have induced any physiologist to give up the conception
  of the intimate connection of muscle and nerve, if the work of Golgi, Ram√≥n y Cajal, and others
  had not brought into prominence the neurone theory, <i>i.e.</i> that each element of the central
  nervous system is an independent element, without real connection with any other element and
  capable of influencing other cells by contact only. These two statements, emanating as they did
  from embryological and anatomical studies respectively, have done much to put into the background
  Hensen's conceptions of the syncytial nature of the motor, neural, and sensory elements, which
  make up the master-tissues of the body, and have led to the view that all the elements of the body
  are alike, in so far as they are formed of separate cells each leading an independent existence,
  without any real intimate connection with each other.</p>

  <p>The further progress of investigation is, it seems to me, bringing us back to the older
  conception, for not only has the neuroblast theory <span class="pagenum"
  id="page466">{466}</span>proved very difficult for physiologists to accept, but also Graham Kerr,
  in his latest papers on the development of Lepidosiren, has shown that there is continuity between
  the nerve-cell and the muscle-cell from the very first separation of the two sets of elements; in
  fact, Hensen is right and His wrong in their respective interpretation of the earliest stages of
  the connection between muscle and nerve. So also, it seems to me, the intimate connection between
  the metabolism of the gland-cell, as seen in the submaxillary gland, and the integrity of its
  nervous connection implies that the connection between nerve-cell and gland-cell is of the same
  order as that between nerve-cell and muscle-cell. Graham Kerr also states in his paper that from
  the very commencement there is, he believes, continuity between nerve-cell and epithelial cell,
  but so far he has not obtained sufficiently clear evidence to enable him to speak positively on
  this point.</p>

  <p>Further, according to the researches of Anderson, the cells of the superior cervical ganglion
  in a new-born animal will continue to grow healthily as long as they remain connected with the
  periphery, even though entirely separated from the central nervous system by section of the
  cervical sympathetic nerve, and conversely, when separated from the periphery, will atrophy, even
  though still connected with the central nervous system. So, also, on the sensory side, Anderson
  has shown that the ganglion-cells of the posterior root-ganglion will grow and remain healthy
  after separation of the posterior roots in a new-born animal, but will atrophy if the peripheral
  nerve is cut, even though they are still in connection with the central nervous system. Further,
  although section of a posterior root in the new-born animal does not affect the development of the
  nerve-cells in the spinal ganglion, and of the nerve-fibres connecting the posterior root-ganglion
  with the periphery, it does hinder the development of that part of the posterior root connected
  with the spinal ganglion.</p>

  <p>These experiments of Anderson are of enormous importance, and force us, it seems to me, to the
  same conclusion as that to which he has already arrived. His words are (p. 511): "I suggest,
  therefore, that the section of peripheral nerves checked the development of motor and sensory
  neurones, not because it blocked the passage of efferent impulses in the first case and the
  reception of stimuli from the periphery in the second, but for the same reason in both cases,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page467">{467}</span>viz. that the lesion disturbed the chemico-physical
  equilibrium of an anatomically continuous (neuro-muscular or neuro-epithelial) chain of cells, by
  separating the non-nervous from the nervous, and that the changes occurring in denervated muscle,
  which I shall describe later (and possibly those in denervated skin), are in part due to the
  reciprocal chemico-physical disturbance effected in these tissues by their separation from the
  nervous tissues; also that the section of the posterior roots checked the development of those
  portions of them still attached to the spinal ganglia, because the chemico-physical equilibrium in
  those processes is maintained not only by the spinal ganglion-cells, but also by the intra-spinal
  cells with which these processes are anatomically continuous."</p>

  <p>What is seen so strikingly in the new-born animal can be seen also in the adult, and in
  Anderson's paper references are given to the papers of Lugaro and others which lead to the same
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>These experiments seem to me distinctly to prove that the connection between the elements of
  the peripheral organ and the proximate neurone is more than one of contact.</p>

  <p>We can, however, go further than this, for, apart from the observations of Apathy, there is
  direct physiological evidence that the vitality of other neurones besides the terminal neurones is
  dependent upon their connection with the peripheral organ, even though their only connection with
  the periphery is by way of the terminal neurone. Thus, as is seen from Anderson's experiments,
  section of the cervical sympathetic nerve in a very young animal causes atrophy of many of the
  cells in the corresponding intermedio-lateral tract, cells which I supposed gave origin to all the
  vaso-constrictor, pilomotor, and sweat-gland nerves. A still more striking experiment given by
  Anderson is the effect of the removal of the periphery upon the medullation of those efferent
  fibres which arise from these same spinal cells, for, as he has shown, section of the nerves from
  the superior cervical ganglion to the periphery in a very young animal delays the medullation in
  the fibres of the cervical sympathetic&mdash;that is, in preganglionic fibres which are not
  directly connected with the periphery but with the terminal neurones in the superior cervical
  ganglion. So also on the afferent side a sufficiently extensive removal of sensory field will
  cause atrophy of the cells of Clarke's column, so that, just as in the case of the primary
  neurones, <span class="pagenum" id="page468">{468}</span>the secondary neurones show by their
  degenerative changes the importance of their connection with the peripheral organs.</p>

  <p>In this way I can conceive the formation of a series of both efferent and afferent relays in
  the nervous system by proliferation of the original neural moiety of the neuro-epithelial
  elements, every one of which is dependent upon its connection with the peripheral epithelial
  elements for its due vitality, the whole system being a scheme for co-ordination of a larger and
  larger number of peripheral elements. Thus the cells of the vasomotor centre are in connection
  with the whole system of segmental vaso-constrictor centres in the lateral horns of the thoracic
  region of the cord, so that to cause atrophy of these cells a very extensive removal of the
  vascular system would be required. Each of the segmental centres in the cord supplies a number of
  sympathetic segments, the connection with all of which would have to be cut in order to ensure
  complete removal of the connection of each of its cells with the periphery, and finally each of
  the cells in the sympathetic ganglia supplies a number of peripheral elements, all of which must
  be removed to ensure complete severance.</p>

  <p>Thus, if we take any arbitrary number, such as 4, to represent the number of peripheral
  organ-elements with which each terminal neurone is connected, and suppose that each neurone has
  proliferated into sets of 4, then a cell of the third order, such as a cell of the vasomotor
  centre, would require the removal of 64 peripheral elements to cause its complete separation from
  the periphery, one of the second order (a cell of the thoracic lateral horn) 16 elements, one of
  the first order (a cell of a sympathetic ganglion) 4 elements.</p>

  <p>Such intimate inter-relationship between the neurones, both afferent and efferent, and their
  corresponding peripheral organs does not imply that all nerve-cells are necessarily as closely
  dependent upon some connection with the periphery, for just as the proliferation of epithelial or
  muscle-cells forms an epithelial or muscular sheet, the elements of which are so loosely, if at
  all, connected together that their metabolism is in no way dependent upon such connection, so also
  a similar proliferation of the neural elements may form connections between nerve-cell and
  nerve-cell of a similarly loose nature.</p>

  <p>It is this kind of proliferation which, in my opinion, would bind together the separate relays
  of efferent and afferent neurones, and <span class="pagenum" id="page469">{469}</span>so give
  origin to reflex actions at different levels. Such neurones would not be in the direct chain of
  either the afferent or efferent neurones, and so not directly connected with the periphery, and
  could therefore be removed without affecting the vitality of either the efferent or afferent chain
  of neurones. In other words, the vitality of the cells on the efferent side ought not to be
  dependent on the integrity of the reflex arc. With regard to the development of the anterior
  roots, Anderson has shown that this is the case, for section of all the posterior roots conveying
  afferent impulses from the lower limb in a new-born animal does not hinder the normal development
  of the anterior roots supplying that limb. Also Mott, who originally thought that section of all
  the posterior roots to a limb caused atrophy of the corresponding anterior roots, has now come to
  the same conclusion as other observers, and can find no degeneration on the efferent side due to
  removal of afferent impulses.</p>

  <p>Again, the process of regeneration after section of a nerve is not in favour of the neuroblast
  theory. There is no evidence that the cut end of a nerve can grow down and attach itself to a
  muscular or epithelial element without the assistance of a nerve tube down which to grow. When the
  cut nerves connected with the periphery degenerate, that applies only to the axis-cylinder and the
  medullary sheath, not to the neurilemma; the connective tissue elements remain alive and form a
  tube into which the growing axon finds its way, and so is conducted to the end-plate or end-organ
  of the peripheral structure.</p>

  <p>Possibly, as suggested by Mott and Halliburton, the products of degeneration of the
  axis-cylinder and medullary sheath stimulate these connective tissue sheath-cells into active
  proliferation, and so bring about the great multiplication of cells arranged as cell-chains, which
  are so often erroneously spoken of as forming the young nerves. These sheath-cells are then
  supposed to re-form and secrete a pabulum which is important for the process of regeneration of
  the down-growing axis-cylinder and medullary sheath. Without such pabulum regeneration does not
  take place, as is seen in the central nervous system, where the sheath of Schwann is absent.</p>

  <p>Again, it is becoming more and more doubtful whether the peripheral terminations of nerves are
  ever really free. As far as efferent nerves are concerned the nervous element may entirely <span
  class="pagenum" id="page470">{470}</span>predominate over the muscular or glandular, as in the
  formation of the electric organs of the Torpedo and Malapterurus, but still the final effect is
  produced by the alteration of the muscle or gland-cell. On the afferent side especially free
  nerve-terminations are largely recognized, or, as in Barker's book, nerves are spoken of as
  arising in connective tissue. Thus the numerous kinds of special sense-organs, such as Pacinian
  bodies, tendon-organs, genital corpuscles, etc., are all referred to by Barker under the heading
  of "sensory nerve beginnings in mesoblastic tissues." Yet the type of these organs has been known
  for a long time in the shape of Grandry's corpuscles or the tactile corpuscles in the duck's bill,
  where it has been proved that the nerve terminates in special large tactile cells derived from the
  surface-epithelium.</p>

  <p>So also with all the others, further investigation tends to put them all in the same category,
  all special sensory organs originating from a localized patch of surface-epithelium. Thus Anderson
  has shown me in his specimens how the young Pacinian body is composed of rows of epithelial cells,
  into each of which a twig from the nerve passes. He has also shown me how, in the case of the
  tendon-organ, each nerve-fibre passes towards the attachment of the tendon and then bends back to
  supply the tendon-organ, thus indicating, as he suggests, how the nest of epithelial cells has
  wandered inwards from the surface to form the tendon-organ. Again, Meissner's corpuscles and
  Herbst's corpuscles are evidently referable to the same class as those of Grandry and Pacini.</p>

  <p>Yet another instance of the same kind is to be found in the chromatophores of the frog and
  other animals which are under the influence of the central nervous system and yet have been
  supposed by various observers to be pigmented connective tissue cells. The most recent work of Leo
  Loeb and others has conclusively shown that such cells are invariably derived from the
  surface-epithelium.</p>

  <p>Finally, in fishes we find the special sense-organs of the lateral line and other accessory
  sensory organs, all of which are indisputably formed from modified surface epithelial cells.</p>

  <p>The whole of this evidence seems to me directly against Barker's classification of sensory
  nerve-beginnings in mesoblastic tissues; in none of these cases are we really dealing with free
  nervous tissue alone, the starting point is always a neuro-epithelial couple.</p>

  <p>We may then, I would suggest, look upon the adult as formed of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page471">{471}</span>a neural syncytium, which we may call the host, which carries with it in
  its meshes a number of free cells not connected with the nervous system. If, then, we confine our
  attention to the host and trace back this neural syncytium to its beginnings in the embryo, we see
  that, from the very nature of the neuro-epithelial couple, each epithelial moiety must approach
  nearer and nearer to its neural moiety, until at last it merges with it; the original
  neuro-epithelial cell results, and we must obtain, as far as the host is concerned, a
  single-layered blastula as the origin of all Metazoa. It follows, further, that there must always
  be continuity of growth in the formation of the host, <i>i.e.</i> in the formation of the
  neuro-epithelial syncytium; that therefore cells which have been previously free cannot settle
  down and take part in its formation, as, for instance, in the case of the formation of any part of
  the gut-epithelium or of muscle-cells from free-living cells.</p>

  <p>Further, since the neural moiety is the one element common to all the different factors which
  constitute the host, it follows that the convergence of each epithelial moiety to the neural
  moiety, as we pass from the adult to the embryo, is a convergence of all outlying parts to the
  neural moiety, <i>i.e.</i> to the central nervous system, if there is a concentrated nervous
  system. Conversely, in the commencing embryo the place from which the spreading out of cells takes
  place, <i>i.e.</i> from which growth proceeds, must be the position of the central nervous system,
  if the nervous system is concentrated. If the nervous system is diffuse, and forms a general
  sub-epithelial layer, then the growth of the embryo would take place over the whole surface of the
  blastula.</p>

  <p>Turning now to the consideration of the second group of tissues, those that are not connected
  with the central nervous system, we find that they include among them such special cells as the
  germinal cells, free cells of markedly phagocytic nature, and cells which were originally free and
  phagocytic, but have settled down to form a supporting framework of connective tissue, and are
  known as plasma-cells. In the embryo we find also in many cases free cells in the yolk, forming
  more or less of a layer, which function as phagocytes and prepare the pabulum for the fixed cells
  of the growing embryo; these cells are known by the name of vitellophags, and in meroblastic
  vertebrate eggs form somewhat of a layer known by the name of periblast. Such cells must be
  included in the second group, and, <span class="pagenum" id="page472">{472}</span>indeed, have
  been said again and again to give origin to the free-living blood-corpuscles of the adult. In
  other cases they are said to disintegrate after their work is done.</p>

  <p>In the adult the free-living lymphocytes and h√¶mocytes reproduce themselves from already
  existing free-living cells, but as we pass back to the embryo there comes a time, comparatively
  late in the history of the embryo, when such free-living cells are not found in the fluids of the
  body, and they are said to arise from the proliferation and setting free of cells which form a
  lining epithelium. Such formation of leucocytes has been especially described in connection with
  the lining epithelium of the c&#x0153;lomic cavities, as stated in Chapter XII., so that
  anatomists look upon the origin of these free cells as being largely from the c&#x0153;lomic
  epithelium, or mesothelium, as Minot calls it.</p>

  <p>Then, again, the free cells which form the germinal cells can be traced back to a germinal
  epithelium, which also is part of the c&#x0153;lom. Thus the suggestion arises that in the embryo
  a cellular lining is formed to a c&#x0153;lomic cavity (mesothelium) composed of cells which have
  no communication with the nervous system, and are capable of a separate existence as free
  individuals, either in the form of germinal cells or of lymphocytes, h√¶mocytes, and plasma-cells,
  so that these latter free cells may be considered as living an independent existence in the body,
  and ministering to it in the same sense as the germ-cells live an independent existence in the
  body. Again, the function of this mesothelium apart from the germ-cell is essentially excretory
  and phagocytic. It is the cells of the excretory organs as well as the lymphocytes which pick up
  carmine-grains when injected. It is the cells of the modified excretory organs, as mentioned in
  Chapter XII., which, according to Kowalewsky and others, give origin to the free leucocytes.</p>

  <p>We see, then, that the conception of a syncytial neuro-epithelial host holding in its meshes a
  number of free cells leads directly to the questions: What is the c&#x0153;lom? To which category
  does its lining membrane belong? and further, also, What is the origin of these free cells?</p>

  <p>The Metazoa have been divided into two great groups&mdash;those which possess a c&#x0153;lom
  (the C&#x0153;lomata; Lankester's C&#x0153;lomoc&#x0153;la) and those which do not
  (C&#x0153;lenterata; Lankester's Enteroc&#x0153;la). As an example of the latter we may take
  Hydra, because it is a very <span class="pagenum" id="page473">{473}</span>primitive form, and
  because its development has been carefully worked out recently by Brauer.</p>

  <p>In Hydra we find a dermal layer of cells and an inner layer of cells separated by a gelatinous
  mass known as mesogl&#x0153;a; in this mass between the dermal and inner layers scattered cells
  are found, the interstitial cells. Now, according to Brauer the position of the germ in Hydra is
  the interstitial cell-layer. One cell of the ovarium becomes the egg-cell, the others have their
  substance changed into yolk-grains, forming the so-called pseudo-cells, and as such afford pabulum
  to the growing egg-cell. Thus we see that in between the dermal and gastral layer of cells a third
  layer of cells is found, composed of free living germ-cells, some of which, by the formation of
  yolk-granules, become degraded into pabulum for their more favoured kinsfolk. These interstitial
  cells are said to arise from the dermal layer, or ectoderm, but clearly, as in other cases,
  germ-cells constitute a class by themselves and cannot be spoken of as originating from
  ectoderm-cells or from hypoderm-cells.</p>

  <p>So also in Porifera, Minchin states: "In addition to the collared cells of the gastral layer,
  and the various cell-elements of the dermal layer, the body-wall contains numerous wandering cells
  or am&#x0153;bocytes, which occur everywhere among the cells and tissues. Though lodged
  principally in the dermal layer, they are not to be regarded as belonging to it, but as
  constituting a distinct class of cells by themselves. They are concerned probably with the
  functions of nutrition and excretion, and from them arise the genital products." Further (p. 31):
  "At certain seasons some of these cells become germ-cells; hence the wandering cells and the
  reproductive cells may be included together under the general term arch√¶ocytes." Also (p. 51):
  "The mesogl&#x0153;a is the first portion to appear as a structureless layer between the dermal
  and gastral epithelia, and is probably a secretion of the former."</p>

  <p>He also points out that in these, the very lowest of the Metazoa, the separate origin of these
  arch√¶ocytes can be traced back to a very early period of embryonic life. Thus in <i>Clathrina
  blanca</i> the ovum undergoes a regular and total cleavage, resulting in the formation of a hollow
  ciliated blastula of oval form. At one point, the future posterior pole of the larva, are a pair
  of very large granular cells with vesicular nuclei, which represent undifferentiated blastomeres
  and are destined to give rise to the arch√¶ocytes, and, therefore, also to the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page474">{474}</span>sexual cells of the adult. Thus, as he says, from the
  very earliest period a distinction is made between the "tissue-forming" cells (my syncytial host)
  and the arch√¶ocytes.</p>

  <p>We see, then, that the origin of all these free-living cells can be traced back to the very
  earliest of the Metazoa. Here between the dermal and gastral layers a gelatinous material, the
  mesogl&#x0153;a is secreted by these layers. This material is non-living, non-cellular. In it live
  free cells which may either be germ-cells, am&#x0153;bocytes, or 'collencytes' (connective tissue
  cells). If this mesogl&#x0153;a were a fluid secretion, then we should have a tissue of the nature
  of blood or lymph; if it were solid, then we should have the foundation of connective tissue,
  cartilage, and bone.</p>

  <p>From this primitive tissue it is easy to see how the special elements of the vascular,
  lymphatic, and skeletal tissues gradually arose, the matrix being provided by the cells of the
  syncytial host and the cellular elements by the arch√¶ocytes. In fact, we have no right to speak of
  these lowest members of the Metazoa as not being triploblastic, as possessing nothing
  corresponding to mesoblast, for in these free cells in the mesogl&#x0153;a we have the origin of
  the mesenchyme of the higher groups. Thus Lankester, talking of mesenchyme, says: "I think we are
  bound to bring into consideration here the existence in many C&#x0153;lentera of a tissue
  resembling the mesenchyme of C&#x0153;lomoc&#x0153;la. In <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'Scyphomedus&#x0153;'">Scyphomedus√¶</span>, in Ctenophora, and in Anthozoa,
  branched fixed and wandering cells are found in the mesogl&#x0153;a which seem to be the same
  thing as a good deal of what is distinguished as mesenchyme in C&#x0153;lomoc&#x0153;la. These
  appear to be derived from both the primitive layers; some produce spicules, others fibrous
  substance, others again seem to be am&#x0153;bocytes with various functions. It appears to be
  probable that, though it may be necessary to distinguish other elements in it, the mesenchyme of
  C&#x0153;lomoc&#x0153;la is largely constituted by cells, which are the mother-cells of the
  skeletotrophic group of tissues, and are destined to form connective tissues, blood-vessels, and
  blood."</p>

  <p>Thus we see that the earliest Metazoa were composed of a dermal and gastral epithelium, with a
  sub-epithelial nervous system connecting the parts together, which formed, as it were, a host,
  carrying around free living cells of varying function, all of which may be looked on as derived
  from arch√¶ocytes, <i>i.e.</i> germ-cells. From these the c&#x0153;lomatous animals arose, and here
  also we find, according to <span class="pagenum" id="page475">{475}</span>present-day opinion,
  that the c&#x0153;lom arose in the first place in the very closest connection with the germ-cells
  or gonads. Thus Lankester, in his review of the history of the c&#x0153;lom, states<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The numerous embryological and anatomical researches of the past twenty years seem to me to
  definitely establish the conclusion that the c&#x0153;lom is primarily the cavity, from the walls
  of which the gonad cells (ova or spermata) develop, or which forms around those cells. We may
  suppose the first c&#x0153;lom to have originated by a closing or shutting off of that portion of
  the general archenteron of Enteroc&#x0153;la (C&#x0153;lentera), in which the gonads developed as
  in Aurelia or as in Ctenophora. Or we may suppose that groups of gonad mother cells, having
  proliferated from the endoderm, took up a position between it and the ectoderm, and there acquired
  a vesicular arrangement, the cells surrounding the cavity in which liquid accumulated.</p>

  <p>"The c&#x0153;lom is thus essentially and primarily (as first clearly formulated by Hatschek)
  the perigonadial cavity or gonoc&#x0153;l, and the lining cells of gonadial chambers are
  c&#x0153;lomic epithelium. In some few groups of C&#x0153;lomoc&#x0153;la the c&#x0153;loms have
  remained small and limited to the character of gonoc&#x0153;ls. This seems to be the case in the
  Nemertina, the Planarians, and other Platyhelmia. In some Planarians they are limited in number,
  and of individually large size; in others they are numerous."</p>

  <p>When Lankester says that "the lining cells of gonadial chambers are c&#x0153;lomic epithelium,"
  that is equivalent to saying that the lining cells of the c&#x0153;lom form an epithelium which
  was originally gonadial, provided that, as seems to me most probable, his second suggestion, of
  the c&#x0153;lom being formed from gonadial mother-cells which have taken up an intermediate
  position between endoderm and ectoderm and there acquired a vesicular arrangement, is the true
  one. It does not seem to me possible to conceive of the gonads arising from cells of the epiblast
  or of the hypoblast, in the sense that such cells are differentiated cells belonging to a layer
  with a definite meaning. When we consider that the gonad gives origin to the whole of a new
  individual, that in the protozoan ancestors of the Metazoa their ultimate aim and object was the
  formation of gonads, it seems a wrong conception to speak of the gonads as formed from cells
  belonging either to the gut-wall or to the external epithelium. The gonads must stand in a
  category by themselves; they represent a whole, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page476">{476}</span>while the other cells represent only a part; they cannot therefore be
  derived from the latter. They may, and indeed do, give rise to cells of a subordinate character,
  but they cannot rightly be spoken of as derived from such cells. The very fact mentioned by
  Lankester, that in the lowest c&#x0153;lomatous Metazoa, the Platyhelminthes, the c&#x0153;loms
  are limited to the character of simple gonoc&#x0153;ls, strongly points to the conclusion that all
  the c&#x0153;lomic cells were originally of the nature of gonadial cells, and therefore
  free-living and independent of the rest of the cells of the body. Whether the germ-cells appear,
  as in Hydra, to be derived from the ectoblast, or, as is usually stated, from the endoblast, in
  neither case ought they to be classed with the internal or external epithelium; they are
  germ-cells, and the epithelium which they form is neither epiblastic nor hypoblastic, but
  germinal, forming originally a simple gonoc&#x0153;le, afterwards, in the higher forms, the
  c&#x0153;lom with its cells of various function. Thus, to quote again from Lankester, "The
  c&#x0153;lomic fluid and the c&#x0153;lomic epithelium, as well as the floating corpuscles derived
  from that epithelium, acquire special properties and importance over and above the original
  functions subservient to the maturation of the gonadial cells ... the most important developments
  of the c&#x0153;lom are in connection with the establishment of an exit for the generative
  products through the body-wall to the outer world, and further in the specialization of parts of
  its lining epithelium for renal excretory functions."</p>

  <p>Such exits led very early to the formation of c&#x0153;lomoducts, which are true outgrowths of
  the c&#x0153;lom itself (p. 14): "The c&#x0153;lomoducts and the gonoc&#x0153;ls of which they are
  a part, frequently acquire a renal excretory function, and may retain both the function of genital
  conduits and of renal organs, or may, where several pairs are present (metamerized or segmented
  animals), subserve the one function in some segments of the body, and the other function in other
  segments."</p>

  <p>The origin of the c&#x0153;lom and its derivatives from a germinal membrane, as suggested by
  Lankester, appears to me most probable, and, if true, it carries with it conclusions of
  far-reaching importance, for it necessitates that all the cells which line true c&#x0153;lomic
  cavities, and their derivatives, belong to the category of free-living cells, and are not
  connected with the nervous system. The cells in question are essentially those which line serous
  cavities and those which form excretory glands such as the kidneys. In the latter organ we ought
  especially to be able to obtain a clear answer to this question, for is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page477">{477}</span>it not a gland which secretes into a duct and might therefore be expected
  to be innervated in the same way as other secretory glands? Although there is a strong <i>prim√¢
  facie</i> presumption in favour of the existence of renal secretory nerves, yet according to the
  universal opinion of physiologists no evidence in favour of such nerves has hitherto been found;
  all the phenomena of excretion of urine consequent on nerve stimulation are explicable by the
  action of nerves on the renal vessels, not on the renal cells. Not only is the physiological
  evidence negative up to the present time, but also, I think, the histological. On the one hand,
  Retzius has failed to find nerve-connections with kidney-cells; on the other, Berkley has obtained
  such evidence with the Golgi method, but failed entirely with methylene blue. I do not myself
  think that the evidence of the Golgi method alone is sufficient without corroboration by other
  methods, and, in any case, Berkley's evidence does not show the nerve-fibres terminating in the
  kidney-cells, in the same way as can be shown by modern methods to exist in the case of epithelial
  cells of the surface, etc. Quite recently another paper on this subject has appeared by Smirnow,
  who appears to have obtained better results than those given by Berkley.</p>

  <p>Apart from these physiological and histological considerations, this question is also dependent
  upon the nature of the development of the excretory organs, for, according to Lankester, all
  excretory organs may be divided into the two classes of nephridial organs and c&#x0153;lomostomes,
  of which the former are largely derived from epiblast. We should, therefore, expect to find
  secretory nerves to nephridial organs, though possibly not to c&#x0153;lomostomes. The kidneys of
  the Mammalia are supposed to be true c&#x0153;lomostomes, although, according to Goodrich's
  researches, the excretory organs in Amphioxus are solenocytes, <i>i.e.</i> true nephridia.</p>

  <p>As to the lining epithelium of the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial
  cavities&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the mesothelium&mdash;there is no definite evidence that these cells
  are provided with nerves. Such surfaces are remarkably insensitive in the healthy condition, and
  the pain in such cavities is essentially a pressure phenomenon and referable to special
  sense-organs, such as Pacinian bodies, etc., rather than to the mesothelium itself.</p>

  <p>These sense-organs are identical in structure with those in the skin, and, as Anderson has
  shown, the nerves of these organs <span class="pagenum" id="page478">{478}</span>medullate at the
  same time as those in the skin, and both obtain their medullary sheaths earlier than any other
  nerves, whether afferent or efferent. However difficult it may be to explain this fact, only one
  conclusion seems to me possible&mdash;these Pacinian bodies, like the skin Pacinians, originate
  from a nest of surface epithelial cells, a conclusion which is extremely probable on my theory of
  the origin of vertebrates, but not, as far as I can see, on any other.</p>

  <p>At the present moment the weight of evidence is, to my mind, in favour of the lining
  endothelium of the c&#x0153;lomic cavities being composed of free cells, unconnected with the
  nervous system rather than the reverse, but I must confess that the question is undecided. If it
  be true that the c&#x0153;lomic lining is partly enteroc&#x0153;lic and partly gonoc&#x0153;lic,
  as Lankester teaches, then it would be natural that its cells should be in connection with the
  nervous system, to some extent at all events. This view is, however, based on very slender
  foundations. If the mesothelium is composed of cells capable of becoming free, it cannot give rise
  to the skeletal muscles, and it cannot therefore be right to speak of the skeletal muscles as
  derived from the lining cells of a part of the primary c&#x0153;lom. The phylogenetic history of
  the musculature of the different animals points strongly to its intimate connection with and
  derivation from surface epithelial cells rather than from c&#x0153;lomic mesothelial cells. Thus
  in the c&#x0153;lenterates, as seen in Hydra, the muscular layer arises directly from a
  modification of the surface epithelial cells; and right up to the annelids, even to the highest
  form in the Polych√¶ta, we still see it stated that the musculature, both circular and
  longitudinal, arises from the ectoderm. In the Oligoch√¶ta and Hirudinea, according to Bergh, there
  are five rows of teloblasts on each side, of which four are ectodermic and give rise to the
  nerve-ganglia and the circular muscles, while one is mesoblastic and forms the nephridial organs
  and the longitudinal muscles. (The latter statement is, according to Bergh, well known, and is not
  particularly shown by him. These longitudinal muscle-bands always lie close against the nervous
  system at their first formation, and may well have been derived in connection with it.)</p>

  <p>It is apparently only in the Vertebrata that the lining cells of the c&#x0153;lomic cavity are
  definitely stated to give origin to the body-musculature, and taking into account on the one hand
  the evidence of Graham Kerr as to the intimate connection between nerve-cell and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page479">{479}</span>muscle-cell from the very beginning, and on the other the
  manner in which all the skeletal muscles of the adult are lined with a lymphatic endothelium, I am
  strongly inclined to believe that at the closing up of the myoc&#x0153;le, when the myomere
  separates from the mesomere, the lining cells remain scattered in among the forming muscle-cells
  and form the ultimate lymphatic tissue of the muscles. If this is really so, then the evidence in
  favour of the mesothelium being composed of free cells not connected with the nervous system would
  be much strengthened, for, on the one hand, an intimate relation exists between the connective
  tissue cells and the endothelium of the roots of the lymphatic vessels, a relation which,
  according to Virchow, has rendered it impossible to draw any sharp line of distinction between the
  two; and, on the other, the lymphatic endothelium merges into the lining cells of the great serous
  cavities of the body.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to conceive of an animal possessing a nervous system which is not in
  connection with sensory and muscular tissues; an isolated nerve-cell is a meaningless possession;
  but it is equally natural to conceive of a germ-cell being isolated, capable of living an
  independent existence. Such a difference between the two kinds of tissues must have existed from
  the very commencement of the Metazoa, so that we must, it seems to me, imagine that in the
  formation of the Metazoa from the Protozoa the whole of the body of the latter did not break up
  into a mass of separate gonads, each capable of becoming a free-living protozoan similar to its
  parent, but that a portion proliferated into a multinucleated syncytium while the remainder formed
  the free-living gonads. This multinucleated syncytium, or host, as it might be called, would still
  continue to exist for the purpose of carrying further afield the immortal gonads, which need no
  longer be all shed at one time.</p>

  <p>In such an animal as <i>Volvox globator</i> we have an indication of the very kind of animal
  postulated as connecting the single-celled Protozoa and the multi-cellular Metazoa, for it
  consists of a many-celled case which forms a hollow sphere, each of the cells being provided with
  flagella for the purpose of locomotion of the sphere, except a certain number which are not
  flagellated; the latter leave the case to swim freely in the fluid contained within the sphere,
  and forming spermaries and ovaries, conjugate, maturate, and then are set free by the rupture of
  the encircling locomotor host.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page480">{480}</span></div>

  <p>This conception of the predecessors of the Metazoa being composed of a mortal host, holding
  within itself the immortal sexual products, leads naturally to the idea of the separate
  development of the host from that of the germ-cells <i>ab initio</i>, so that the study of the
  development of the Metazoa means the study of two separate constituents of the metazoan
  individual&mdash;on the one hand, the elaboration of the elements forming the syncytial host, on
  the other, of those derived from the free-living independent germ-cells. The elaboration of the
  host means the differentiation of the protoplasm into epithelial, muscular, and nervous elements,
  by means of which the gonads were carried further afield and their nourishment as well as that of
  the host ensured.</p>

  <p>The <i>r√¥le</i> of the nervous system as the middleman between internal and external muscular
  and epithelial surfaces was, I imagine, initiated from the very earliest time. The further
  evolution of the host consisted in a greater and greater differentiation and elaboration of this
  neuro-epithelial syncytium, with the result of a steadily increasing concentration and
  departmental centralization of the main factor of the syncytium; in other words, it led to the
  origin and elaboration of a central nervous system. In the interstices of this syncytium the
  gonads were placed, and at first, doubtless, the life of the host ended when all the germ-cells
  had been set free. 'Reproduce and die' was, I imagine, the law of the Metazoa at its earliest
  origin, and throughout the ages, during all the changes of evolution, the reminiscence of such law
  still manifests itself even up to the highest forms as yet reached. With the differentiation of
  the syncytial host there came also differentiation of the free-living gonads, so that only some of
  them attained to the perfection of independent existence, capable of continuing the species; while
  others became subordinate to the first and provided them with pabulum, manufacturing within
  themselves yolk-spherules, and thus in the shape of yolk-cells ministered to the developing
  egg-cell. Thus arose a germinal epithelium of which only a few of the elements passed out of the
  host as perfect individuals, the remainder being utilized for the nutrition of these few. Such
  yolk-cells of the germinal epithelium would still, however, retain their character as free cells
  totally independent of the syncytial host, and, situated as they were between the internal and
  external epithelium, capable of am&#x0153;boid movement, would naturally have their phagocytic
  action <span class="pagenum" id="page481">{481}</span>utilized either as yolk-cells for the
  providing of pabulum to the egg-cell, or as excretory cells for the removal and rendering harmless
  of deleterious products of all kinds. Thus the free cells of the body would become differentiated
  into the three classes of germ-cells, yolk-cells, and excretory cells.</p>

  <p>Further, the mass of gonads, which originally occupied so large a space within the interior of
  the host, necessarily, as the tissues of the host differentiated more and more, took up less and
  less space in proportion to the whole bulk of the host and formed a germinal mass of cells between
  the outer and inner epithelial layers. This germinal mass formed an epithelium, some of the
  members of which acted as scavengers for the inner and outer layers of the host, with the result
  that fluid accumulated between the two parts of the germinal epithelium in connection respectively
  with the external and internal epithelial surfaces of the host, and thus led to the formation of a
  gonoc&#x0153;le, which, by obtaining an external opening, a c&#x0153;lomostome, gave origin to the
  c&#x0153;lom.</p>

  <p>Again, with the longer life of the host, the setting free of the gonads no longer necessitating
  the destruction of the host, and also the gonads themselves requiring a longer and longer time to
  be fed up to maturity, the bulk and complexity of the whole organism increased and special
  supporting structures became a necessity. The host itself could and did provide these to a certain
  extent by secretions from its epithelial elements, but the intermediate supports were provided by
  the system of phagocytic cells utilizing the fluids of the body, at first in the shape of
  plasma-cells able to move from place to place, then settling down to form a connective tissue
  framework, and, later on, cartilage and bone.</p>

  <p>So also were gradually evolved the whole of the endothelial structures; the lymph-cells,
  blood-cells, etc., all having their origin from the free cells of the body, which themselves
  originated in the extension of a germinal epithelium. Just as in a bee-hive the egg-cells may form
  the fully developed sexual animal, whether drone or queen bee, or the asexual host of workers, so
  in the body of the Metazoa the free cells may form either male or female germ-cells spermatozoa,
  or ova, or a host of workers, scavengers, repairers, food-providers, all useful to the community,
  all showing their common origin by their absolute independence of the nervous system.</p>

  <p>Two points of great importance follow from this method of looking <span class="pagenum"
  id="page482">{482}</span>at the problem. First, the evolution of the animal kingdom means
  essentially the evolution of the host, for that is what forms the individual; secondly, as the
  host is composed of a syncytium, the common factor of whose elements is the neural moiety, it
  follows that the tissue of central importance for the evolution of the host must be, as indeed it
  is, the nervous system. Further, seeing that the growth of the individual means the orderly
  spreading out of the epithelial moiety away from the neural moiety, it follows that the germ-band
  or germ-area from which growth starts must be in the position of the nervous system. If then, the
  nervous system in the animal is a concentrated one, then the growth will emanate from the position
  of such nervous system. If, on the other hand, the nervous system is diffused, then the growth
  will also be diffused.</p>

  <p>In this book I have throughout argued that the ancestors of vertebrates belonged to a great
  group of animals which gave origin also to Limulus and scorpion-like animals; it is therefore
  instructive to see what is the nature of the development of such animals. For this purpose I will
  take the development of the scorpion, as given by Brauer, for he has worked out its development
  with great thoroughness and care. His papers show that the segmentation is discoidal, and results
  in an oval blastodermic area lying on a large mass of yolk. Very early there separates out in this
  area genital cells and yolk-cells, which latter move freely into the yolk and prepare it into a
  fluid pabulum for the nutrition of the cells of the embryonic shield or germ-band. These free
  yolk-cells do not take part in the formation of the germinal layers, nor does the endoderm when
  formed give origin to free yolk-cells.</p>

  <p>The cells of the germ-band form a small compact area, in which by continual mitosis the cells
  become more than one-layered, and soon it is found that those cells which lie close against the
  fluid pabulum form a continuous layer and absorb the nutritious material for themselves and the
  rest of the embryo. While this area is thus increasing in thickness by continuous development, the
  group of genital cells remains always apart, increasing in number, but being always in a state of
  isolation from the cells of the rest of the growing area. Thus from the very first Brauer's
  observations on the development of the scorpion point to the formation of a syncytial host
  containing separate genital cells. The continuous layer of cells against the fluid pabulum, which
  is already functioning as a gut, and may <span class="pagenum" id="page483">{483}</span>therefore
  be called hypoblast, spreads continuously over the yolk, as also does the surface epithelial
  layer, or epiblast. Such spreading is always a continuous one for both surfaces, so that the yolk
  is gradually enclosed by a continuous orderly growth from the germ-band, and not by the settling
  down of free cells in the yolk here and there to form the gut-lining. This steady orderly
  development proceeds owing to the nourishment afforded by the activity of the free cells or
  vitellophags and the absorbing power of the hypoblast, a steady growth round the yolk which
  results in the formation of the gut-tube, the outer covering and all the muscular and excretory
  organs. Where, then, is this starting-point, this germ-band from which the whole embryo grows? It
  forms the mid ventral area of the adult animal, it corresponds exactly to the position of the
  central nervous system. The whole phenomenon of embryonic growth in the scorpion is exactly what
  must take place on the argument deduced from the study of the adult that the animal arises as a
  neuro-epithelial syncytium, and we see that that layer of cells which is situated next to the
  food-material forms the alimentary tube. It is not a question whether such layer is ventral or
  dorsal to the neural cells, but whether it is contiguous to or removed from the food-material.</p>

  <p>Take, again, a meroblastic vertebrate egg as of the bird. Again we find free cells passing into
  the yolk to act as vitellophags, the so-called periblast cells; again we see that the embryo
  starts from a germ-band or embryonic shield, and spreads from there continuously and steadily;
  again we see that the layer of cells which lies against the yolk absorbs the fluid pabulum for the
  growing cells; again we see that the area from which the whole process of growth starts is that of
  the central nervous system, and again we see that those cells which are contiguous to the food
  form the commencing gut, and are therefore called hypoblast, though in this case they are ventral
  not dorsal to the neural layer.</p>

  <p>The comparison of these two processes shows that there is one common factor, one thing
  comparable in the two, one thing that is homologous and is the essential in the formation of that
  part of the animal which I have called the host, and that is the central nervous system. Whether
  the epithelial layer which lies ventrally to it or the one that is dorsal forms the gut depends
  upon the position of the food-mass. Where the food is, there will be the absorbing layer. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page484">{484}</span>Where the food is not, there will be no gut formation,
  whatever may have been the previous history of that layer. If, then, we suppose, as I do, that the
  vertebrate arose from a scorpion-like animal without any reversal of dorsal and ventral surfaces,
  and that the central nervous system remained the same in the two animals, then the comparison of
  the development of the two embryos shows that the one would be derived from the other if the
  yolk-mass shifted from the dorsal to the ventral side of the nervous system. This would leave the
  dorsal epithelial layer of the original syncytium free from pabulum; it would no longer form the
  definite gut, <i>but it would still tend to form itself in the same manner as before, would still
  grow from a ventrally situated germ-band dorsalwards to form a tube, would recapitulate its past
  history, and show how the alimentary canal of the arthropod became the neural canal of the
  vertebrate</i>. Although this alimentary canal is formed in the same way as before, it is no
  longer recognized as homologous with the scorpion's alimentary canal, but because it no longer
  absorbs pabulum, and does not therefore form the definite gut, it is called an epiblastic tube,
  and, in the words of Ray Lankester, has no developmental importance.</p>

  <p>All the arthropods are built up on the same type, and in all the development may in its broad
  outlines be referred to the type just mentioned. So also with the vertebrate group; in both cases
  the position of the central nervous system determines the starting area of embryonic growth. In
  both cases the absorbing layer shows the position of the definite gut. A concentrated nervous
  system of this type is common to all the segmented animals from the annelids to the vertebrates,
  and in all cases the germ-band which indicates the first formation of the embryo is in the
  position of this nervous system.</p>

  <p>As far as the embryo is concerned, there is no great difficulty in the conception that the
  yolk-mass may have shifted from one side to the other in passing from the arthropod to the
  vertebrate, for in the arthropod the embryo at first is surrounded by yolk and then passes to the
  periphery of the egg. If it is permissible to speak of a dorsal and ventral surface to an egg, and
  we may imagine the egg held with such dorsal surface uppermost, then the yolk would be situated
  ventrally to the embryo, as in the vertebrate, if the protoplasmic cells of the embryo rose from
  their central position to the surface through the yolk, while if they sank through the yolk, the
  yolk would be situated dorsally to the embryo, as in the arthropod.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page485">{485}</span></div>

  <p>In cases where there is no yolk, or very little, as in Lucifer and Amphioxus respectively, the
  embryo is compelled to feed itself at a very early age; such embryos form a free-swimming pelagic
  ciliated blastula, the invagination of which, for the purpose of collecting food material out of
  the open sea, is the simplest method of obtaining nutriment. Here, as in other cases, it is the
  physiological necessity which determines the method of formation of the gut, and such similarity
  of appearance as exists between the gastrula of Lucifer and that of Amphioxus, by no means implies
  that the gut of the adult Lucifer is homologous with the gut of Amphioxus.</p>

  <p class="sp3">I have compared two meroblastic eggs of the two classes respectively, because the
  scorpion's egg is meroblastic. I imagine that no real difficulty arises with respect to
  holoblastic eggs, for the experiments of O. Hertwig and Samassa show that by centrifugalizing,
  stimulating, and breaking down of large spheres the holoblastic amphibian egg may be converted
  into a meroblastic one, and then development will proceed regularly, <i>i.e.</i> in this case also
  the growth proceeds from the animal pole; the large cells of the vegetal pole, like the yolk-cells
  of the meroblastic egg, manufacture pabulum for the growing syncytial host.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Summary.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp5">
    <p>Any attempt to discover how vertebrates arose from invertebrates must be based upon the study
    of Comparative Anatomy, of Pal√¶ontology, and of Embryology. The arguments and evidence put
    forward in the preceding chapters show most clearly how the theory of the origin of vertebrates
    from pal√¶ostracans is supported by the geological evidence, by the anatomical evidence, and by
    the embryological evidence. Of the three the latter is the strongest and most conclusive, if it
    be taken to include the evidence given by the larval stage of the lamprey.</p>
    <p>The stronghold of embryology for questions of this sort is the Law of Recapitulation, which
    asserts that the history of the race is recapitulated to a greater or less extent in the
    development of the individual. In the previous chapters such recapitulation has been shown for
    all the organs of the vertebrate body. In this respect, then, embryology has proved of the
    greatest value in confirming the evidence of relationship between the pal√¶ostracan and the
    vertebrate, given by anatomical and geological study.</p>
    <p>There is, however, another side to embryology, which claims that the tissues of all the
    Metazoa are built up on the same plan; that in all cases in the very early stage of the embryo
    three layers are formed, the epiblast, mesoblast, and hypoblast; that in all animals above the
    Protozoa these three layers are <span class="pagenum" id="page486">{486}</span>homologous, the
    epiblast in all cases forming the external or skin-layer, the hypoblast the internal or
    gut-layer.</p>
    <p>Such a theory, therefore, as is advocated in this book, which turns the gut of the arthropod
    into the neural canal of the vertebrate, and makes a new gut for the vertebrate from the
    external surface must be wrong, as it flatly contradicts the fundamental germ-layer theory.</p>
    <p>Of recent years grave doubts have been thrown upon the validity of this theory, doubts which
    have increased in force year by year as more and more facts have been discovered which are not
    in agreement with the theory. So much is it now discredited that any criticism against my
    theory, which is based upon it, weighs nothing in the balance against the positive evidence of
    recapitulation already stated. If the germ-layer theory is no longer credited, upon what
    fundamental laws is embryology based?</p>
    <p>In this chapter I have ventured to suggest a reply to this question, based on the uniformity
    of the laws of growth throughout the existence of the individual.</p>
    <p>In the adult animal the body is composed of two kinds of tissues, those which are connected
    with or at all events are under the control of the nervous system, and those which are capable
    of leading a free life independent of the nervous system. These two kinds of tissues can be
    traced back from the adult to the embryo, and it is the task of embryology to find out how these
    two kinds of tissue originate.</p>
    <p>The following out of this line of thought leads to the conception that, throughout the
    Metazoa, the body is composed of a host which consists of the master-tissues of the body, and
    takes the form of a neuro-epithelial syncytium, within the meshes of which free living
    independent organisms or cells live, so to speak, a symbiotic existence.</p>
    <p>The evidence points to the origin of all these free cells from germ-cells, and thus leads to
    the conception that the blastula stage of every embryo represents two kinds of cells, the one
    which will form the mortal host being the locomotor neuro-epithelial cell, the other the
    independent immortal symbiotic germ-cell. Such conception leads directly to the conclusion that
    the blastula stage of every member of the Metazoa is the embryonic representation of a Protozoan
    ancestor of the Metazoa; an ancestor, whose nature may be illustrated by such a living form as
    <i>Volvox globator</i>, which, like a blastula, is composed of a layer of cells forming a hollow
    sphere. These cells partly bear cilia, and so form a locomotor host, partly are of a different
    character, and form male and female germ-cells. The latter leave the surface of the sphere, pass
    as free individuals into its fluid contents, form spermaries and ovaries, and then by the
    rupture of the mortal locomotor host pass out into the external medium, as free swimming young
    Volvox.</p>
    <p>It is of interest to note that such members of the Protozoa are among the most highly
    developed of the members of this great group.</p>
    <p>From such a beginning arose in orderly evolution, on the one hand, all the neuro-muscular and
    neuro-epithelial structures of the body&mdash;the so-called master-tissues; on the other, the
    germ-cells, the blood-corpuscles, lymph-corpuscles plasma and excretory cells, connective tissue
    cells, cartilage and bone-cells, etc., all of them independent of the central nervous system,
    all traceable to a modification of the original germ-cells.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="page487">{487}</span></div>
    <p>Such a view of the processes of embryology brings embryology into harmony with comparative
    anatomy and phylogeny, for it makes the central nervous system and not the alimentary canal the
    most important factor in the development of the host.</p>
    <p>The growth of the individual, whether arthropod or vertebrate, spreads from the position of
    the central nervous system, regardless of whether that position is a ventral or dorsal one with
    respect to the yolk-mass. Where the pabulum is, there is the definite gut, the lining walls of
    which are called in the embryo, hypoblast; but when the pabulum is no longer there, although a
    tube is formed in the same manner as the alimentary canal of the arthropod, it is now called an
    epiblastic tube, and is known as the neural tube of the vertebrate.</p>
    <p>This is the great fallacy of the germ-layer theory, a fallacy which consists of an argument
    in a vicious circle: thus the alimentary canal is homologous in all of the Metazoa, because it
    is formed of hypoblast, but there is no definition of hypoblast, except that it is always that
    layer which forms the definitive alimentary canal.</p>
    <p>When, after the process of segmentation has been completed, a free swimming blastula results,
    unprovided with any store of pabulum in the shape of yolk, then the same physiological necessity
    causes such a form to obtain its nutriment from the surrounding medium. The simplest way to do
    this is by a process of invagination, in consequence of which food particles are swept into the
    invaginated part and then absorbed. For this reason in such cases true gastrul√¶ are formed, as
    in the case of Amphioxus among the vertebrates, and Lucifer among the crustaceans; such a
    formation does not in the least imply that the gut of the arthropod is homologous with that of
    the vertebrate. The resemblance between the two is not a morphological one, but due to the same
    physiological necessity. They are analogous formations, not homologous.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The muscular tissues are found to be formed in close connection with the nervous
    tissues, and in very many cases are described as formed from epiblast, so that there are strong
    reasons for placing them in a special category of the so-called mesoblastic tissues. If they be
    separated out, then it seems to me, the rest of the mesoblast would consist of the free-living
    cells of the body, which are not connected with the central nervous system. In watching, then,
    the formation of mesoblast, defined in this way, we are watching the separation out from the
    master-tissues of the body of the independent skeletal and excretory cells.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The discussion in the last chapter on the "Principles of Embryology" completes the evidence
  which I am able to offer up to the present time in favour of my theory of the "Origin of
  Vertebrates." There are various questions which I have left untouched, but still are well worth
  discussion, and may be mentioned here. The first of these is the significance of the giant
  nerve-cells and giant nerve-fibres so characteristic of the brain-region of the lower vertebrates.
  In most fishes two very large cells are most conspicuous objects in any transverse section of the
  <i>medulla oblongata</i> at the level of entrance of the auditory nerves. Each of these cells
  gives off a number of processes, some of which pass in the direction of the auditory nerves and
  one very large axis-cylinder process which forms a giant-fibre, known by the name of a Mauthnerian
  fibre. Each Mauthnerian fibre crosses the middle line soon after its origin from the giant-cell,
  and passes down the spinal cord on the opposite side right to the tail. Here, near the end of the
  spinal cord, it breaks up into smaller fibres, which are believed by Fritsch and others to pass
  out directly into the ventral roots to supply the muscles of the tail. Thus Bela Haller says: "The
  Mauthnerian fibres are known to give origin to certain fibres which supply the ventral roots of
  the last three spinal nerves, so that their terminal branches serve, in all probability, for the
  innervation of the muscles of the tail-fin." They do not occur in the eel, according to Haller, or
  in Silurus, according to K√∂lliker. <span class="pagenum" id="page489">{489}</span>Their absence in
  those fishes, in which a well-developed tail-fin is also absent, increases the probability of the
  truth of Fritsch's original conclusion that these giant-fibres are associated axis-cylinders for
  certain definite co-ordinated movements of the fish, especially for the lateral movement of the
  tail.</p>

  <p>In Ammoc&#x0153;tes, instead of two Mauthnerian fibres, a number of giant-fibres are found.
  They are called M√ºllerian fibres, and arise from giant-cells which are divisible into two groups.
  The first group consists of three pairs situated headwards of the level of exit of the trigeminal
  nerves. Two of these lie in front of the level of exit of the oculomotor nerves, and one pair is
  situated at the same level as the origin of the oculomotor nerves. The second group consists of a
  number of cells on each side at the level of the entrance of the fibres of the auditory
  nerves.</p>

  <p>The M√ºllerian fibres largely decussate, as described by Ahlborn, and then become the most
  anterior portion of the white matter of the spinal cord, forming a group of about eight fibres on
  each side (Fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a>). A few fibres are also found laterally, and slightly
  dorsally, to the grey matter. These giant-fibres pass down the spinal cord right to the anal
  region; their ultimate destination is unknown. Mayer considers that in the first part of their
  course they correspond to those tracts of fibres known as the "posterior longitudinal bundles" in
  other vertebrates. I imagine, therefore, that the spinal part of their course represents the two
  antero-lateral descending tracts. The second group of giant-cells, which appears to have some
  connection with the auditory nerves, may represent "Deiter's nucleus." The whole system is
  probably the central nervous part of a co-ordination mechanism, which arises entirely in the
  pro-otic or prosomatic region of the brain&mdash;the great co-ordinating and equilibrating region
  <i>par excellence</i>.</p>

  <p>If we turn now to the arthropod it is a striking coincidence that in the crayfish and in the
  lobster the work of Retzius, of Celesia, of Allen, and of many others demonstrates the existence
  of an equilibration-mechanism for the swimming movements of the tail-muscles, which is carried out
  by means of giant-fibres. These giant-fibres are the axis-cylinder processes of giant-cells,
  situated exclusively in the brain-region, and they run through the whole ventral ganglionic chain
  in order to supply the muscles of the tail. In the ventral nerve-cord of the crayfish, according
  to Retzius, two specially large <span class="pagenum" id="page490">{490}</span>giant-fibres exist,
  each of which breaks up, at the last abdominal ganglion, into smaller fibres, which pass directly
  out with the nerves to the tail-fin. Allen has shown that, in addition to these two specially
  large giant-fibres, there are a number of others, some of which, similarly to the M√ºllerian fibres
  of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, cross the middle line, while some do not. Each of these arises from a large
  nerve-cell and passes to one or other of the last pair of abdominal ganglia. The latter fibres, he
  says, send off collaterals, while the two specially large giant-fibres do not. The cells which
  give origin to all these large, long fibres are situated in or in front of the prosomatic region
  of the brain, similarly to the giant-cells, which give rise to the corresponding M√ºllerian fibres
  of Ammoc&#x0153;tes. I do not know how far this system is represented in Limulus or Scorpio.</p>

  <p>It is, to my mind, improbable that the Mauthnerian fibres pass out directly as motor fibres to
  the muscles of the tail-fin; it is more likely that they are conducting paths between the
  equilibration-mechanism in connection with the VIIIth nerve and the spinal centres for the
  movements of the tail. Similarly, with respect to the arthropod, it is difficult to believe that
  the motor fibres for the tail-muscles arise in the brain-region. In either case, the striking
  coincidence remains that the movements of the tail-end of the body are regulated by means of
  giant-fibres which arise from giant-cells in the head-region of the body in both the Arthropoda
  and the lowest members of the Vertebrata.</p>

  <p>The meaning of this system of giant-cells and giant-fibres in both classes of animals is well
  worthy of further investigation.</p>

  <p>Another important piece of comparative work which ought to help in the elucidation of this
  problem is the comparison of the blood- and lymph-corpuscles of the vertebrate with those of the
  invertebrate groups. As yet, I have not myself made any observations in this direction, and feel
  that it is inadvisable to discuss the results of others until I know more about the facts from
  personal observation.</p>

  <p>The large and important question of the manner of formation of the vertebrate skin has only
  been considered to a slight extent. A much more thorough investigation requires to be made into
  the nature of the skin of the oldest fishes in comparison with the skin of Ammoc&#x0153;tes on the
  one side, and of Limulus and the Pal√¶ostraca on the other.</p>

  <p>The muscular system requires further investigation, not so much <span class="pagenum"
  id="page491">{491}</span>the different systems of the striated voluntary musculature&mdash;for
  these have been for the most part compared in the two groups of animals in previous
  chapters&mdash;as the involuntary unstriped musculature, about which no word has been said. The
  origin of the different systems of unstriped muscles in the vertebrate is bound up with the origin
  of the sympathetic system and its relation to the cranial and sacral visceral systems. The reason
  why I have not included in this book the consideration of the sympathetic nervous system is on
  account of the difficulty in finding any such system in Ammoc&#x0153;tes. Also, so far as I know,
  the distribution of unstriped muscle in Ammoc&#x0153;tes has not been worked out.</p>

  <p>One clue has arisen quite recently which is of great importance, and must be worked out in the
  future, viz. the extraordinary connection which exists between the action of the sympathetic
  nervous system and the action of adrenalin. This substance, which is obtained from the medullary
  part of the adrenal or suprarenal glands, when injected into an animal produces the same effects
  as stimulation of the nerves, which belong to the lumbo-thoracic outflow of visceral nerves,
  <i>i.e.</i> the system known as the sympathetic nervous system, which is distinct from both the
  cranial and sacral outflows of visceral nerves. The similarity of its action to stimulation of
  nerves is entirely confined to the nerves of this sympathetic system, and never resembles that of
  either the cranial or sacral visceral nerves.</p>

  <p>Another most striking fact which confirms the great importance of this connection between the
  adrenals and the sympathetic nervous system from the point of view of the evolution of the latter
  system is that the extract of the adrenals always produces the same effect as that of stimulation
  of the nerves of the sympathetic system, whatever may be the animal from which the extract is
  obtained. Thus adrenalin obtained from the elasmobranch fishes will produce in the highest mammal
  all the effects known to occur upon stimulation of the nerves of its sympathetic system.</p>

  <p>Further, the cells, which are always associated with the presence of this peculiar
  substance&mdash;adrenalin&mdash;stain in a characteristic manner in the presence of chromic salts.
  In Ammoc&#x0153;tes patches of cells which stain in this manner have been described in connection
  with blood-vessels in certain parts, so that, although I know of no definite evidence of the
  existence of cell-groups in Ammoc&#x0153;tes corresponding to the ganglia of the sympathetic
  system in other vertebrates, it is <span class="pagenum" id="page492">{492}</span>possible that
  further investigation into the nature and connection of these "chromaffine" cells may afford a
  clue to the origin of the sympathetic nervous system. At present it is premature to discuss the
  question further.</p>

  <p>Finally, another test as to the kinship of two animals of different species must be considered
  more fully than I have been able to do up to the present time. This test is of a totally different
  nature to any put forth in previous pages. It is known as the "biological test" of relationship,
  and is the outcome of pathological rather than of physiological or anatomical research. It is
  possible that this test may prove the most valuable of all. At present we do not know sufficiently
  its limitations and its sources of error, especially in the case of cold-blooded animals, to be
  able to look upon it as decisive in a problem of the kind considered in this book.</p>

  <p>The nature of this test is as follows: It has been found that the serum of the blood of another
  animal, when injected in sufficient quantity into a rabbit, will cause such a change in the serum
  of that rabbit's blood that when it is added to the serum of the other animal a copious
  precipitate is formed, although the serum of normal rabbit's blood when mixed with that of another
  animal will cause no precipitate whatever. This extraordinary production of a precipitate in the
  one case and not in the other indicates the production of some new substance in the rabbit's serum
  in consequence of the introduction of the foreign serum into the rabbit, which brings about a
  precipitate when the rabbit's serum containing it is mixed with the serum originally injected. The
  barbarous name "antibody" has been used to express this supposed substance in accordance with the
  meaning of such a word as "antitoxin," which has been a long time in use in connection with
  preventive remedies against pathogenic bacteria. Now, it is found that the rabbit's serum
  containing a particular "antibody" will cause a precipitate only when added to the serum of the
  blood of the animal from which the "antibody" was produced or to the serum of the blood of a
  nearly related animal.</p>

  <p>Further, if that animal is closely related a precipitate will be formed nearly as copious as
  with the original serum, if more distantly related a cloudiness will occur rather than a
  precipitate, and if the relationship is still more distant the mixture of the two sera will remain
  absolutely clear. Thus this test demonstrates the close relationship of man to the anthropoid apes
  and his more distant <span class="pagenum" id="page493">{493}</span>relationship to monkeys in
  general. By this method very evident blood-relationships have been demonstrated, especially
  between members of the Mammalia.</p>

  <p>I therefore started upon an investigation into the possibility of proving relationship in this
  way between Limulus and Ammoc&#x0153;tes, with the kind assistance of Mr. Graham Smith. I must
  confess I was not sanguine of success, as I thought the distance between Limulus and
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes was too great. Dr. Lee, of New York, kindly provided me with most excellent serum
  of Limulus, and the first experiments showed that the anti-serum of Limulus gave a most powerful
  precipitate with its own serum. Graham Smith then tried this anti-serum of Limulus with the serum
  of Ammoc&#x0153;tes, and to his surprise, and mine, he obtained a distinct cloudiness, indicative
  of a relationship between the two animals. This, however, is not considered sufficient, the
  reverse experiment must also succeed. I therefore, with Graham Smith, obtained a considerable
  amount of blood from the adult lampreys at Brandon, and produced an anti-serum of Petromyzon,
  which gave some precipitate with its own serum, but not a very powerful one. This anti-serum tried
  with Limulus gave no result whatever, but at the same time it gave no result with serum from
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes, so that the experiment not only showed that Petromyzon was not related to
  Limulus, but also was not related to its own larval form, which is absurd.</p>

  <p>Considerable difficulties were encountered in preparing the Petromyzon anti-serum owing to the
  extreme toxic character of the lamprey's serum to the rabbit; in this respect it resembled that of
  the eel. It is possible that the failure of the lamprey's anti-serum was due to the necessity of
  heating the serum sufficiently to do away with its toxicity before injecting it into the rabbit.
  At this point the experiments have been at present left. It will require a long and careful
  investigation before it is possible to speak decisively one way or the other. At present the
  experiment is positive to a certain extent, and also negative; but the latter proves too much, for
  it proves that the larva is not related to the adult.</p>

  <p>Some day I hope this "biological test" will be of use for determining the relationships of the
  Tunicata, the Enteropneusta, Amphioxus, etc., as well as of Limulus and Ammoc&#x0153;tes.</p>

  <p>The origin of Vertebrates from a Pal√¶ostracan stock, as put forward in this book, gives no
  indication of the systematic position <span class="pagenum" id="page494">{494}</span>of the
  Tunicata or Enteropneusta. Neither the Tunicata nor Amphioxus can by any possibility be on the
  direct line of ascent from the invertebrate to the vertebrate. They must both be looked upon as
  persistent failures, relics of the time when the great change to the vertebrate took place. The
  Enteropneusta are on a different footing; in their case any evidence of affinity with vertebrates
  is very much more doubtful.</p>

  <p>The observer Spengel, who has made the most exhaustive study of these strange forms, rejects
  <i>in toto</i> any connection with vertebrates, and considers them rather as aberrant annelids.
  The so-called evidence of the tubular central nervous system is worth nothing. There is not the
  slightest sign of any tubular nervous system in the least resembling that of the vertebrate. It is
  simply that in one place of the collar-region the piece of skin containing the dorsal nerve of the
  animal, owing to the formation of the collar, is folded, and thus forms just at this region a
  short tube. My theory explains in a natural manner every portion of the elaborate and complicated
  tube of the vertebrate central nervous system. In the Balanoglossus theory the evolution of the
  vertebrate tube in all its details from this collar-fold is simple guesswork, without any
  reasonable standpoint. Similarly, the small closed diverticulum of the gut in Balanoglossus, which
  is dignified with the name of "notochord," has no right to the name. As I have already said, it
  may help to understand why the notochord has such a peculiar structure, but it gives no help to
  understanding the peculiar position of the notochord. The only really striking resemblance is
  between the gill-slits of Amphioxus and of the Enteropneusta. In this comparison there is a very
  great difficulty, very similar to that of the original attempts to derive vertebrates from
  annelids&mdash;the gill-slits open ventrally in the one animal and dorsally in the other. In both
  animals an atrial cavity exists which is formed by pleural folds, and in these pleural folds the
  gonads are situated so that the similarity of the two branchial chambers seems at first sight very
  complete. In the Enteropneusta, however, there are certain forms&mdash;Ptychodera&mdash;in which
  these pleural folds have not met in the mid-line in this branchial region, and in these it is
  plainly visible that these folds, with their gonads, spring from the ventral mid-line and arch
  over the dorsal region of the body. Equally clearly Amphioxus shows that its pleural folds, with
  the gonads, spring from the dorsal side of the animal, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page495">{495}</span>and grow ventralwards until they fuse in the ventral mid-line (<i>cf.</i>
  Fig. <a href="#fig168">168</a>).</p>

  <p>As far, then, as this one single striking similarity between Amphioxus and the Enteropneusta is
  concerned it necessitates the reversal of dorsal and ventral surfaces to bring the two branchial
  chambers into harmony.</p>

  <div class="ac w45 fcenter sp2">

      vessel; <i>g.</i>, gonads; <i>NC.</i>, notochord; <i>C.N.S.</i>, central nervous system.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In a mud-dwelling animal, like Balanoglossus, which possesses no appendages, no special
  sense-organs, it seems likely enough that ventral and dorsal may be terms of no particular
  meaning, and consequently what is called ventral in Balanoglossus may correspond to what is dorsal
  in Amphioxus; in this way the branchial regions of the two animals may be closely compared. Such
  comparison, however, immediately upsets the whole argument of the vertebrate nature of
  Balanoglossus based on the relative position of the central nervous system and gut, for now that
  part of its nervous system which is looked upon as the central nervous system in Balanoglossus is
  ventral to the gut, just as in a worm-like animal, and not dorsal to it as in a vertebrate.</p>

  <p>There is absolutely no possibility whatever of making such a detailed comparison between
  Balanoglossus and any vertebrate, as I have done between a particular kind of arthropod and
  Ammoc&#x0153;tes. In the latter case not only the topographical anatomy of the organs in the two
  animals is the same, but the comparison is valid even to microscopical structure. In the former
  case the origin of almost all <span class="pagenum" id="page496">{496}</span>the vertebrate organs
  is absolutely hypothetical, no clue is given in Balanoglossus, not even to the segmented nature of
  the vertebrate. The same holds good with the evidence from Embryology and from Pal√¶ontology. I
  have pointed out how strongly the evidence in both cases confirms that of Comparative Anatomy. In
  neither case is the strength of the evidence for Balanoglossus in the slightest degree comparable.
  In Embryology an attempt has been made to compare the origin of the c&#x0153;lom in Amphioxus and
  in Balanoglossus. In Pal√¶ontology there is nothing, only an assumption that in the Cambrian and
  Lower Silurian times a whole series of animals were evolved between Balanoglossus and the earliest
  armoured fishes, which have left no trace, although they were able to hold their own against the
  dominant Pal√¶ostracan race. The strangeness of this conception is that, when they do appear, they
  are fully armoured, as in Pteraspis and Cephalaspis, and it is extremely hard luck for the
  believers in the Balanoglossus theory that no intermediate less armoured forms have been found,
  especially in consideration of the fact that the theory of the origin from the Pal√¶ostracan does
  not require such intermediate forms, but finds that those already discovered exactly fulfil its
  requirements.</p>

  <p>One difficulty in the way of accepting the theory which I have advocated is perhaps the
  existence of the Tunicata. I cannot see that they show any affinities to the Arthropoda, and yet
  they are looked upon as allied to the Vertebrata. I can only conclude that both they and Amphioxus
  arose late, after the vertebrate stock had become well established, so that in their degenerated
  condition they give indications of their vertebrate ancestry and not of their more remote
  arthropod ancestry.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the way in which vertebrates arose on the earth as suggested in this book
  carries with it many important far-reaching conclusions with respect to the whole problem of
  Evolution.</p>

  <p>When the study of Embryology began, great hopes were entertained that by its means it would be
  possible to discover the pedigree of every group of animals, and for this end all the stages of
  development in all groups of animals were sought for and, as far as possible, studied. It was soon
  found, however, that the interpretation of what was seen was so difficult, as to give rise to all
  manner of views, depending upon the <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'idiosyncracy'.">idiosyncrasy</span> of the observer. At his will he decided
  whether any appearance was c&#x0153;nogenetic or palingenetic, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page497">{497}</span>with the result that, in the minds of many, embryology has failed to
  afford the desired clue.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the geological record was looked upon as too imperfect to afford any real
  help; it was said, and is said, that the Cambrian and pre-Cambrian periods were so immense, and
  the animals discovered in the lower Silurian so highly organized, as to compel us to ascribe the
  origination of all the present-day groups to this immense early period, the animals of which have
  left no trace of their existence as fossils.</p>

  <p>In consequence of, or at all events following upon, the supposed failure of embryology and of
  geology to solve the problem of the sequence of evolution of animal life, a new theory has arisen,
  which goes very near to the denial of evolution altogether. This is the theory of parallel
  development. It discards the old picture of a genealogical tree with main branches arising at
  different heights, these again branching and branching into smaller and smaller twigs, and
  substitutes instead the picture of the ribs of a fan, every rib running independently of every
  other, each group represented by a rib reaching its highest development on the circumference of
  the fan and coming nearer and nearer to a common point at the handle of the fan. This point of
  convergence, where all the groups ultimately meet, is so far back as to reach to the lowest living
  organisms.</p>

  <p>This, in my opinion, unscientific and inconceivable suggestion has arisen largely in
  consequence of a conception which has become firmly fixed in the minds of very many writers on
  this subject&mdash;the conception that in the evolution of every group, the higher members of the
  group are the most specialized in the peculiarities of that group, and it is impossible to obtain
  a new group with different peculiarities from such specialized members. If, then, a higher group
  is to arise from a lower, it must arise from the generalized members of that lower group, in other
  words, from the lowest members or those nearly akin to the next lower group.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the highest members of this latter group are too specialized, and again we must go
  to the more generalized members of the group. In this way each separate specialized group is put
  on one side, and so the conception of parallel development comes into being.</p>

  <p>The evidence given in this book dealing with the origin of vertebrates strikes at the
  foundations of this belief, for it presents an <span class="pagenum"
  id="page498">{498}</span>image of the sequence of evolution of animal forms in orderly upward
  progress, caused by the struggle for existence among the members of the race dominant at the time,
  which brought about the origin of the next higher group not from the lowest members of the
  dominant group, but from some one of the higher members of that group.</p>

  <p>The great factor in evolution has been throughout the growth of the central nervous system;
  from that group of animals which possessed the highest nervous system evolved up to that time the
  next higher group must have arisen.</p>

  <p>In this way we can trace without a break, always following out the same law, the evolution of
  man from the mammal, the mammal from the reptile, the reptile from the amphibian, the amphibian
  from the fish, the fish from the arthropod, the arthropod from the annelid, and we may be hopeful
  that the same law will enable us to arrange in orderly sequence all the groups in the animal
  kingdom.</p>

  <p>This very same law of the paramount importance of the development of the central nervous system
  for all upward progress will, I firmly believe, lead to the establishment of a new and more
  fruitful embryology, the leading feature of which will be, as suggested in the last chapter, not
  the attempt to derive from the blastula three germ-layers common to all animals, but rather two
  sets of organs&mdash;those which are governed by the nervous system and those which are
  not&mdash;and thus by means of the development of the central nervous system obtain from
  embryology surer indications of relationship than are given at present.</p>

  <p>The great law of recapitulation, which asserts that the past history of the race is indicated
  more or less in the development of each individual, a law which of late years has fallen somewhat
  into disrepute, owing especially to the difficulty of interpreting the embryological history of
  the vertebrate, is triumphantly vindicated by the theory put forward in this book. Each separate
  vertebrate organ, one after the other, as shown in the last chapter, indicates in its development
  the manner in which it arose from the corresponding organ of the arthropod. There is no failure in
  the evidence of embryology, the failure is in the interpretation thereof.</p>

  <p>So, too, my theory vindicates the geological method. There is no failure here; on the contrary,
  the record of the rocks proclaims with startling clearness not only the sequence of evolution in
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page499">{499}</span>vertebrate kingdom itself, but the origin of
  the vertebrate from the most highly-developed invertebrate race.</p>

  <p>The study of the comparative anatomy of organs down to the finest details has always been a
  most important aid in finding out relationship between animals or groups of animals. My theory
  endorses this view to the uttermost, and especially indicates the study of the central nervous
  system and its outgoing nerves as that comparative study which is most likely to afford valuable
  results.</p>

  <p>As for the individual, so for the nation; as for the nation, so for the race; the law of
  evolution teaches that in all cases brain-power wins. Throughout, from the dawn of animal life up
  to the present day, the evidence given in this book suggests that the same law has always held. In
  all cases, upward progress is associated with a development of the central nervous system.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The law for the whole animal kingdom is the same as for the individual. "Success in
  this world depends upon brains."</p>
